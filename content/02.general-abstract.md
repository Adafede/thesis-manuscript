## Abstract {.page_break_before .unnumbered}

The detailed assessment of the composition of plants or plant-derived products is of the utmost interest to industrial sectors, as well as to public health and basic research.
The metabolites contained in the natural extracts (NE) of plants constitute the plant metabolome.
The metabolome can be divided into core and specialized metabolome.
Specialized metabolites are produced by plants to assure their survival in a competitive environment.
Only 1% of the 300,000 reported specialized metabolites are available as commercial reference standards.
In the assessment of NE composition, current validated methods for correct qualification and quantification require standards.
Given this limitation, current analytical methods for NE composition assessment focus on the study of a few specific and often non-bioactive markers.
For EN profiling, due to its high sensitivity and separation power, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a method of choice.
Annotation of massive and complex spectral data sets generated by these state-of-the-art high-resolution LC-MS systems remains a challenge.
To overcome this challenge by leveraging prior knowledge and modern computational tools, dereplication allows for focused efforts on potentially novel compounds.
Dereplication is highly dependent on data availability, and reporting practices in this regard are crucial.
In addition to annotation, quantitative aspects are also crucial for NE composition.
They are needed to document the use of NEs as end products (phytopharmaceuticals, cosmetics, or natural ingredients) and to assess the presence of possible toxic compounds.
They can also justify the contribution of specific molecules to the overall bioactivity of an extract.
Nevertheless, generic methods to generate a quantitative assessment of the large panel of plant metabolites are still lacking.
The concentrations of specialized metabolites in plants vary by several orders of magnitude.
Typically, only a dozen of metabolites account for the majority of the extractâ€™s mass, while hundreds are present in trace amounts.
Therefore, effective procedures are needed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the metabolome composition of an NE, generically addressing both qualitative and quantitative aspects.
By replacing validated quantitative methods with universal detection methods, this work aims to combine qualitative and quantitative aspects in an automated generic manner.
The impact of this methodological work is evaluated on public data, collaborations, as well as on well-known plants of the European pharmacopeia chosen to ideally represent the diversity of plant metabolites.
Finally, its application to different research questions is demonstrated.
In detail, flavoring plants of industrial interest containing large quantities of bitter principles are studied, for example, *Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H.Karst.
This work is expected to lead to the more efficient conduct of plant metabolomics research for public health, food and beverage safety, and basic science.
