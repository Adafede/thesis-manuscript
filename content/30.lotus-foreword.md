# Establishment of an Open Knowledge Base for Natural Products Research {#sec:lotus .page_break_before}

## Foreword {.unnumbered}

As explained earlier, access to previously generated data and chemical knowledge is mandatory for efficient NP research.
In this chapter, an open knowledge management solution to document NP occurrences is presented, in the form of the *Lotus Initiative*.
This initiative addresses the above-mentioned concerns and represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a comprehensive and collaborative NPs knowledge base.
With 750,000+ referenced structure-organism pairs, LOTUS is actually one of the biggest and best annotated resources for NPs occurrences available free of charge and without any restriction.
Within the frame of current computational approaches in NP research and related fields, these documented structure-organism pairs should allow a more complete understanding of organisms and their chemistry.

This chapter is based on a research article published during the thesis [@doi:10.7554/eLife.70780]. 
This chapter has been reformatted, without content changes to the published version.
Some additional information not contained in the original article is available as *[Addendum](#addendum-lotus)*.
All references are compiled in the end of the thesis manuscript.
