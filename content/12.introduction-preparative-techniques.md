## Preparative Techniques {#sec:prep}

Figure @fig:intro-metabolomes introduces the concept of *metabolome*\footnotemark{}.
\footnotetext{This concept will be discussed later.}
It will be used to guide the reading, detailing the main techniques and methods linked to each *metabolome* level.

![**Schematic view of the *metabolomes*.**](images/intro-metabolomes.pdf "intro-metabolomes"){#fig:intro-metabolomes short-caption="Schematic View of the *Metabolomes*" align="center" width="100%"}

The *plant metabolome* represents the first level.
The word *metabolome* was introduced in 1998 [@doi:10/fkzwzj].
As a first approximation, the metabolome corresponds the small molecules, often termed metabolites, that can be found in an organism.
«*The real*» metabolome is an abstract notion and is actually not accessible.

The second level is the *extracted metabolome*.
It represents all metabolites that chemists are able to extract from the plant.
While not everything is extracted, it is to be noted that some additional chemicals, not originally present in the plant, are also produced during this step.

The third level corresponds to the *detected metabolome*.
After extraction, only a part of what has been extracted can be detected by modern instruments.
This part varies depending on the technology(ies) used for the analyses.

Furthermore, only a portion of the *detected metabolome* can be *qualified*, and an even smaller portion *quantified* with sufficient confidence.
This confidence depends heavily on the method used.

Targeted methods, because they only consider only a restricted set of metabolites, rely on the assumption that the knowledge about metabolites and the respective pathways in which they are involved is complete.
The advantage of a targeted approach is that it provides more precise and accurate quantitative information.

Untargeted methods, on the other hand, attempt to analyze all metabolites.
They are capable to capture information from unknown metabolites, or not known to be produced by a specific organism under a specific condition.
Thus, untargeted approaches offer additional information that is lost by targeted approaches but cannot completely replace them.

The classical reductionist approach used in analytical chemistry starts from the least targeted approach possible to finally lead to highly targeted analyses.
In this process, the first reduction\footnotemark{} step consists in selecting samples that are (ideally) representative of a given organism, at a given time, under a given condition.
\footnotetext{Not to be interpreted in the chemical sense.}
What is often called *the metabolome* of an organism is therefore in reality more a *mixture of some metabolomes*.
The second reduction step is the method of extraction used.

### The *Extracted Metabolome*

To get the above-described *mixture of some metabolomes*, the first necessary step is to identify and collect the plant material [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

#### The *Collected Metabolome*

Usually, an always rarer experienced botanist or taxonomist [@doi:10.1038/471037d; @doi:10.1525/bio.2011.61.12.4; @doi:10.1186/1742-9994-8-25] is needed to identify the plant.
To help experts in verifying the identification, and as a permanent scientific archive, voucher specimens should be deposited in herbaria, including at least one major institution [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

Depending on the type of study, caution should be given to the number of samples collected.
The sample size is a key factor for later statistical treatment [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbu052; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-338]. 
Moreover, multiple plant parts should be collected to ensure the extracts prepared are representative of the range of metabolites produced by the plant [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323], as it is known that composition can vary greatly depending on the organs, or depending on external (a)biotic or factors [@doi:10.1080/0735-260291044269].

#### The *Dried Metabolome*

Except for particular applications, such as flower volatiles notably, it is rare to directly extract the fresh plant material.
Therefore, the plant material is usually dried and ground (coarsely, not until a powder is obtained).
Even if often disregarded, these steps heavily influence the content of the sample.
For example, high amounts of organic acids are released from cellular compartments during grinding, which can lead to hydrolysis reactions [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

#### The *Solvated Metabolome*

Different techniques of extraction exist [@doi:10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.01.014], varying in cost and level of complexity.
The most used in [NP](#np) chemistry consists in placing the dried and ground sample in a solvent.
The constituents diffuse from the sample to the solvent, until saturation.
In the case of large drug discovery campaigns, this step is usually performed with a succession of different solvents.
The general protocol consists of an initial defatting step, removing non-polar constituents [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323]. 
Then, eventually, a second partition step removes the very polar constituents. 
The resulting extract is best tailored for screening against of cell lines, in vivo systems, and enzyme-based assays [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

#### The *Enriched Metabolome*

The extract can be selectively enriched in specific compounds, either directly during the extraction step, or afterward.
This is of the reason alkaloids are heavily studied in [NP](#np) chemistry.
As they contain basic amines, they can be easily selectively extracted with sequential acid-base extractions [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

Another way to selectively enrich parts of the metabolome is through solid phase extraction ([SPE](#spe)).
It will be detailed in Section @sec:intro-chrom.

##### The *Non-interfering Metabolome*

While enriching specific metabolites can be part of the sample preparation, depleting others can be considered as its counterpart.
Multiple [NP](#np)s are known to interfere with biological assays [@doi:10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b00947; @doi:10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01009], and are therefore frequently depleted during sample preparation.

One of the most notable examples is curcumin [@doi:10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00975].
Some receptor-binding assays are also known to be heavily influenced by the fatty acids content [@doi:10.1211/0022357991777092; @doi:10.1021/np000620d].
Additional examples are plant pigments [@doi:10/d46x64; @doi:10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00005] or tannins [@doi:10.1055/s-0029-1234876].

#### The *Artifacted Metabolome*

During all previously mentioned steps, additional compounds end in the prepared sample.
These can come from solvent and container impurities, or different types of reactions.
One of the most complete lists to date has been issued in [@isbn:9780080858494].
The previously mentioned alkaloids, for example, can react with highly reactive phosgene created from the chloroform used for extraction and then combine with alcohols of the solvent [@doi:10.3109/10242420109003642; @pmid:6130900]
Among the other known important reactions, isomerization processes and ways to prevent them are well described [@doi:10/bsv96j].

Finally, it is to be noted that plasticizers, mainly phthalates are almost always contaminating samples, with some cases representing more than half of the extracted mass [@doi:10.1186/2008-2231-21-43].
While this could seem a relatively easy issue to solve, studies showed the ability of certain organisms to produce phthalates [@doi:10.1074/JBC.M109811200], thus making it more challenging to discriminate extraction artifacts from compounds present *in situ*.

#### The *Separated Metabolome* (Chromatography) {#sec:intro-chrom}

The last preparative technique used in phytochemical analysis is chromatography.
The chromatographic step(s) can be performed at different stages of the analysis, the main ones being detailed below.

Historically, in [NP](#np) chemistry, chromatography was performed with open-column chromatography packed with silica gel [@isbn:978-0-08-085817-3].
It was first used to separate plant pigments, the reason why it is named so, as bands of different colors appeared during the very first experiments.
The principle of chromatography is an interplay between the analyte, the stationary phase, and 
the mobile phase.
The mobile phase can either remain stable (isocratic mode), or change gradually (gradient mode).

Over the years, with the same principle, this separation technique evolved into more efficient, miniaturized setups.
The first improvement was made by thin layer chromatography [@doi:10/frhkgg].
Thin layer chromatography was then further improved with the use of particles of silica of smaller size, leading to high-performance thin layer chromatography [@doi:10.1021/ac902945t].
These techniques are still used today in phytochemistry.

Other important pre-concentration techniques are [SPE](#spe) (often use for pesticide [@doi:10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.01.024] or xenobiotic residues [@doi:10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.10.051] analysis) and vacuum liquid chromatography ([VLC](#vlc)).
Their use varies depending on the amounts, as [SPE](#spe) allows only for small amounts of extract to be concentrated while [VLC](#vlc) allows for more.
The possibility to separate higher amounts comes at the expense of a lower resolution.
In chromatography, the resolution is expressed in *theoretical plates* for the isocratic mode and in *peak capacity* for the gradient mode.
The above-mentioned techniques are generally used to enrich the sample before analysis, not directly coupled to the analysis.

Preparative techniques that can be coupled to a direct detection are Medium Pressure [LC](#lc) ([MPLC](#mplc)), preparative High Performance [LC](#lc) ([HPLC](#hplc)), and now even preparative Ultra High Performance [LC](#lc) ([UHPLC](#uhplc)).
Other chromatographic techniques (e.g. Gas chromatography ([GC](#gc), supercritical fluid chromatography, or countercurrent chromatography) can be coupled directly to detectors, but as they were not used in this work, they will not be detailed.
As mentioned previously, the difference comes from the size, shape, and amount of the stationary phase.

It should be noted that in addition to the particle size of the stationary phase, its composition can also vary considerably, allowing for multiple types of interaction with the analytes.
Thus, depending on the composition of the stationary phase, the analytes will be retained in a completely different way.
The two mostly used stationary phases in [LC](#lc) are C~18~, or reversed phase (mainly for apolar compounds), and Hydrophilic Interaction [LC](#lc) ([HILIC](#hilic)) (mainly for polar compounds).
One of the reasons for this choice is the compatibility of the solvents usually used in this mode with current mass spectrometers, which facilitates the on-line coupling of chromatographic methods with the detector.
