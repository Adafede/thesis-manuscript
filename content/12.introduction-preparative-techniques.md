## Preparative Techniques {#sec:prep}

Figure @fig:intro-metabolomes introduces the concept of *metabolome*\footnotemark{}.
\footnotetext{This concept will be discussed later.}
It will be used to guide the reading, detailing the main techniques and methods linked to each *metabolome* level.

![**Schematic view of the *metabolomes*.**](images/intro-metabolomes.pdf "intro-metabolomes"){#fig:intro-metabolomes short-caption="Schematic View of the *Metabolomes*" align="center" width="100%"}

The *plant metabolome* represents the first level.
The word *metabolome* was introduced in 1998 [@doi:10/fkzwzj].
As a first appproximation, the metabolome corresponds the small molecules, often termed metabolites, that can be found in an organism.
«*The real*» metabolome is an abstract notion and is actually not accessible.

The second level is the *extracted metabolome*.
It represents all metabolites that chemists are able to extract from the plant.
While not everything is extracted, it is to be noted that some additional chemicals, not originally present in the plant, are also produced during this step.

The third level corresponds to the *detected metabolome*.
After extraction, only a part of what has been extracted can be detected by modern instruments.
This part varies depending on the technology(ies) used for the analyses.

Furthermore, only a portion of the *detected metabolome* can be *qualified*, and an even smaller portion *quantified* with sufficient confidence.
This confidence depends heavily on the method used.

Targeted methods, because they only consider only a restricted set of metabolites, rely on the assumption that the knowledge about metabolites and the respective pathways in which they are involved is complete.
The advantage of a targeted approach is that it provides more precise and accurate quantitative information.

Untargeted methods, in contrary, attempt to analyze all metabolites.
They are capable to capture information from unknown metabolites, or not known to be produced by a specific organism under a specific condition.
Thus, untargeted approaches offer additional information that is lost by targeted approaches but cannot completely replace them.

The classical reductionist approach used in analytical chemistry start from the least targeted approach possible to finally lead to highly targeted analyses.
In this process, the first reduction\footnotemark{} step consists in selecting samples that are (ideally) representative of a given organism, at a given time, under a given condition.
\footnotetext{Not to be interpreted in the chemical sense.}
What is often called *the metabolome* of an organism is therefore in reality more a *mixture of some metabolomes*.
The second reduction step is the method of extraction used.

### The *Extracted Metabolome*

To get the above described *mixture of some metabolomes*, the first necessary step is to identify and collect the plant material [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

#### The *Collected Metabolome*

Usually, an always rarer experienced botanist or taxonomist [@doi:10.1038/471037d; @doi:10.1525/bio.2011.61.12.4; @doi:10.1186/1742-9994-8-25] is needed to identify the plant.
To help experts in verifying the identification, and as a permanent scientific archive, voucher specimens should be deposited in herbaria, including at least one major institution [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

Depending on the type of study, caution should be given to the number of samples colllected.
The sample size is a key factor for later statistical treatment [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbu052; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-338]. 
Moreover, multiple plant parts should be collected to ensure the extracts prepared are representative of the range of metabolites produced by the plant [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323], as .
It is known that composition can vary greatly depending on external biotic or abiotic factors [@doi:10.1080/0735-260291044269].

#### The *Dried Metabolome*

Except for particular applications, such as flower volatiles notably, it is rare to directly extract the fresh plant material.
Therefore, the plant material is usually dried and ground (coarsely, not until a powder is obtained).
Even if often misregarded, these steps heavily influence the content of the sample.
For example, high amounts of organic acids are released from celllulalr compartments during grinding, which can lead to hydrolysis reactions [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

#### The *Solvated Metabolome*

Different techniques of extraction exist [@doi:10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.01.014], varying in cost and level of complexity.
The most used in [NP](#np) chemistry consists in placing the dried and ground sample in a solvent.
The constituents diffuse from the sample to the solvent, until saturation.
In the case of large drug discovery campaigns, this step is usually performed with a succession of different solvents.
The general protocol consists of an initial defatting step, removing non-polar constituents [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323]. 
Then, eventually, a second partition step removes the very polar constituents. 
The resulting extract is best tailored for screening against of cell lines, in vivo systems, and enzyme-based assays [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

#### The *Enriched Metabolome*

The extract can be selectively enriched in specific compounds, either directly during the extraction step, or afterward.
One of the reason alkaloids are heavily studied in [NP](#np) chemistry is because of the ease of their selective extraction.

<!-- 3.1 Lipids

Fatty acids have been found to give false-positive results in assays for cyclo-oxygenase activity and in some receptor-binding assays (37,38). Iodine vapor in a closed chamber will reveal lipids as brown spots. Other general thin-layer chromatography (TLC) reagents that are appropriate for detecting fatty acids are presented in Chap. 4. Extracts in which fatty acids are thought to be major components can be analyzed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy to determine whether characteristic signals for fatty acids are present. In their 1H-NMR spectra, an intense, broad peak at approx. δ 1.2–1.4 (aliphatic methylenes) is observed, and smaller signals around δ5.3 (olefinic methines) and δ 0.9 (terminal methyl) are often apparent (39). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analytical support is also useful in this regard, as many common fatty acids ionize in the negative mode. It is usually possible to infer which major fatty acids are present by examination of the molecular weights of the major components and by comparison with authentic standards (40). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can be used to identify fatty acids in a mixture, without direct comparison with standards (39).

In addition to the methods mentioned above, fatty acids and other lipid constituents can be separated from the more polar extract components by vacuum-liquid chromatography (VLC, see Chap. 5) using petroleum ether or n-hexane as eluent over silica gel. In some cases, it is convenient to use reversed-phase chromatographic columns or solid-phase extraction cartridges to remove fats and waxes from a sample. The hydrophobic materials will generally be retained until washed from the column by a strong eluent, such as a mobile phase consisting of 100% organic solvent. A simple technique that is often effective is to add a minimal amount of MeOH or MeOH-water to the lipid “solution,” in effect back-extracting the desired compound or compounds. The methanolic partition can then be transferred using a pipet to a separate container, leaving the lipid portion behind.
3.2 Plant Pigments

Plant pigments are present to varying degrees in many plant parts and may interfere with chemical or biological assays. Carotenoids have been reported to interfere with electron capture detection, and a method for removing them by filtering over silver nitrate-impregnated alumina has been described (41). One or more of the following methods is usually suitable for removal of chlorophylls from a sample. Solvent-solvent partition between n-hexane or petroleum ether and 90% MeOH ( Fig. 1 ) serves to concentrate chlorophylls in the upper layer, although this is usually not totally effective. VLC over Diaion LH-20 resin has been used effectively in our laboratory for separation of chlorophyll from other extract constituents. Diaion resin previously washed with acetone is equilibrated with 50% MeOH in deionized water. This may be accomplished by washing the resin several times in a beaker before loading the column or can be carried out after loading the resin in a column. The sample is loaded onto the column head dissolved in a minimum amount of MeOH (or other compatible solvent). A step gradient is used to develop the column. Chlorophylls typically begin to elute with 100% MeOH, and can be completely washed from the column using a 1:1 ratio of acetone and MeOH. Chlorophylls can also be removed by passage over (or standing with) activated charcoal (42), although this carries the risk of loss of important active constituents.
3.3 Vegetable Tannins

Vegetable tannins are plant polyphenols commonly found in plant extracts, often in high concentrations. Two broad groups are recognized, namely polyesters of gallic acid and/or hexahydroxydiphenic acid and their derivatives (the so-called hydrolyzable tannins), and proanthocyanidins (the so-called condensed tannins, containing oligomers of flavan diol units) (43). Many tannins give false-positive results in various biological assays, usually because of their tendency to form nonselective complexes with proteins (including enzymes, receptors, and structural proteins) through multipoint hydrogen bonding (44). Aqueous and organic extracts containing tannins inhibit enzymes, such as topoisomerases 1 and 2 (T-1 and T-2), viral reverse transcriptase, and other enzymes, leading to false-positive results (19,44–46). If tannins are thought to be responsible for the observed bioactivity of a plant extract, the extract can be tested for the presence of tannins (Subheading 4.4.) before and after treatment with tannin-removal methods.

To reduce the amount of tannins present in a chloroform extract, the extract may be washed with an equal volume of 1%-aqueous NaCl. The upper phase is discarded, and the chloroform phase is dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. Tannins can also be removed from aqueous and nonpolar extracts by passage over polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or polyamide, collagen, Sephadex LH-20, silica gel, or by precipitation by a gelatin/sodium chloride solution (5%w/v NaCl and 0.5% w/v gelatin), or caffeine (47,48). PVP/polyamide may be used in batches, or packed in a small column through which the extract is passed, with monitoring of the supernatant or eluate by the ferric-chloride reaction to determine whether the tannins have been removed, although this method is not without a risk of loss of important non-tannin constituents. Phenolic compounds can also be removed by partitioning with a 1%-NaOH solution (49).
3.4 Plasticizers

Plasticizers (see Subheading 2.3.1.) may contaminate solvents, filter papers, plastic apparatus, and chromatographic stationary phases stored in plastic containers. When some grades of MeOH are used in bulk for extraction, followed by concentration of the extract, plasticizers can become a significant portion of the extract (50). Phthalate esters are the plasticizers perhaps most likely to be encountered. Dioctylphthalate sometimes contaminates extracts from plants. Pure dioctylphthalate is a yellow oil that exhibits discernible cytotoxic activity for P-388 murine lymphocytic leukemia cells. Diethylhexylphthalate, reportedly isolated from Aloe vera, was found to induce apoptosis in several human cancer cell lines (51). On TLC plates, dioctylphthalate shows a pink-violet spot when sprayed with concentrated sulfuric acid or concentrated sulfuric acid/ acetic acid (4:1), and heated at 110°C for 5min with R f = 0.4 (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 19:1) (see Note 15).

Plasticizers can be eliminated or greatly reduced by distilling solvents used for extraction and chromatography. Instructions for constructing a distillation apparatus suitable for laboratory-scale purification of solvents can be found in practical chemistry texts (52). A convenient and effective plasticizer removal method that can be used for small amounts of solvent is to “distill” the solvent using a rotary evaporator. The condenser and collecting flask must be clean and free of condensate from other solvents. -->


<!-- 2.3.5 Preparation of Enriched Extracts

When a particular phytochemical constituent or compound class is to be the target of an investigation, specific extraction procedures may be employed to produce extracts enriched in the constituents of interest. In some instances, the polarity of a solution may be modified to cause particular compound classes to precipitate, leaving unwanted compounds in solution. Compounds containing primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, carboxylic acids, lactones, and phenols may be selectively extracted using pH modifications to manipulate the polarity/solubility of the compounds of interest. It is advisable to test the stability of the target compounds on a small scale prior to submitting a major portion of the plant sample or crude extract to one of these potentially damaging techniques.

Figure 2 shows a procedure for isolating mixtures of crude saponins (i.e., steroidal or triterpene glycosides). The plant material is defatted with n-hexane, and extracted with MeOH. The MeOH extract is concentrated under vacuum, and suspended in deionized water (presaturated with n-butanol) and partitioned with n-butanol. Diethyl ether is added to the butanol partition to precipitate the saponin fraction (20). Selective extraction and fractionation of plant sterols (including sapogenins, bufadienolides, and cardiac glycosides) using chemical manipulations and solvent/solvent partitioning have been described (21). Non-alcohols can be separated from alcohols by partitioning between aqueous phthalic anhydride and organic solvent. The alcohols partition into the aqueous layer as half-phthalates and can be regenerated by treatment with sodium methoxide in MeOH. Ketone-containing sterols can be separated from non-ketones by partitioning between organic and aqueous layers with Girard’s hydrazide reagents (H2N.NH.CO.CH2.NR3 +C−), and the ketones can be regenerated by acid hydrolysis (21). 

Alkaloids containing basic amines can be selectively extracted using a modified version of the classic “acid-base shakeout” method ( Fig. 3 ). Mineral acids and strong bases should be avoided in extracting alkaloids (and plant material in general) because of the risk of artifact formation (22,23) (see Subheading 2.4.). The alkaloid extraction scheme outlined employs tartaric acid and Na2CO3 to modify the pH during partitioning. First, the pH is adjusted to at least two units below the pKa values of the basic amines present, causing them to form salts, and thus to partition into the aqueous layer (along with the polar constituents, including quaternary amines and alkaloid N-oxides). The nonpolar constituents partition into the organic layer. After removal of the organic layer, the aqueous layer is made basic, producing the free-base form of the basic alkaloids. Upon partitioning with fresh organic solvent, these alkaloids favor the organic layer, producing an almost pure alkaloid fraction, with the exception of the N-oxides and quaternary amines, that would remain in the aqueous layer. This extraction scheme can also be modified for use with a series of partitioning steps, employing increasingly acidic solutions, amounting to a pH gradient for extraction of neutral (or mildly acidic) to increasingly basic alkaloids. Alkaloids can also be extracted with 10%-acetic acid in EtOH, followed by concentration under vacuum to one-quarter the original volume and precipitation of the crude alkaloid fraction by dropwise addition of NH4OH (24). Alternatively, the plant material may first be wetted with a dilute base (NaHCO3, Na2CO3, or CaCO3 solution), followed by percolation or maceration with nonpolar organic solvent. 

2.3.6 Water Extraction

Although traditional medicines are often prepared by water extraction as infusions (steeping in hot or cold water) or decoctions (extracting in boiling water), many investigators prefer not to work with aqueous extracts. Water-soluble constituents present challenges for conventional isolation methods such as chromatography over silica gel, and water is not an ideal solvent for extraction of many biologically active plant constituents. Water extracts are difficult to concentrate on a rotary evaporator because of the relatively high boiling point of water and its high surface tension. Water preferentially extracts polar compounds, although some ostensibly hydrophobic compounds are also extracted because of co-solubility, and because the polarity of water decreases somewhat at high temperatures. Hot water extraction of Silybum marianum seeds by maceration in water at 85°C extracts proportionally more of the polar constituents, taxifolin and silycristin. Water at 100°C, however, extracts proportionally more of the less-polar compounds, silybinins A and B (26). Aqueous extracts may be freeze dried and re-extracted with a series of solvents in the order of increasing polarity (27). -->

<!-- 2.4 Extraction Artifacts

Most of the solvents used in extraction of plant material have been implicated in artifact formation, either directly or because of common solvent impurities. Certain extraction procedures may also result in artifact formation. In addition to the specific examples that follow, Middleditch (28) has compiled a detailed treatment of the subject of analytical artifacts in chromatography. Phillipson and Bisset (29) reported that brucine and strychnine formed bromochloromethane and DCM adducts during extraction of a species of Strychnos, and concluded that traces of HCl and DCM in the CHCl3 used for extraction reacted with the alkaloids to form artifacts. Phosgene (COCl2), a reactive and toxic compound that rapidly forms from the decomposition of CHCl3 in the presence of air and light, is known to react with alkaloids, particularly those with secondary amino groups (30), and phosgene may combine with alcohols such as MeOH, EtOH, and isopropanol and react with amines to form methyl, ethyl, or isopropyl carbamates (31,32). Several methods have been described for the removal of phosgene from chloroform (see Note 14). DCM does not readily form phosgene; however, DCM extraction of tablets of cyproheptadine hydro-chloride was found to produce an N-chloromethyl adduct, suggesting the potential for an analogous reaction to occur with other compounds in plant extracts (33). MeOH may directly form methoxy group-containing artifacts by acting as a nucleophile with compounds containing α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups, as in the case of a number of minor ring-A methoxylated withanolide artifacts from the aerial parts of Physalis philadelphica (tomatillo) recently isolated and structurally characterized in our laboratory (34). Use of ammonium hydroxide with acetone may produce artifacts that give false-positive responses in alkaloid screening tests (35).

Compounds containing acidic protons at chiral centers are prone to artifact formation, even under relatively mild basic conditions. A classic example is the racemization of (-)-hyoscyamine under the usual “acid-base shakeout” conditions, but other classes of compounds are also susceptible to base-catalyzed modification. For instance, lignans containing strained lactone rings may epimerize under basic conditions, as has been noted for the conversion of podophyllotoxin to picropodophyllin and for other lignans associated with Podophyllum in the presence of organic or inorganic base (36).

In addition to taking steps to reduce the risk of artifact formation, it is important to recognize structural features that indicate that a compound isolated under certain conditions may be an artifact. It is advisable to retain a sample of the original plant material for analysis in case one of the isolates should later be suspected of being an artifact of extraction methods. The reference material can be extracted using nonreactive solvents and mild conditions, and the resulting extract analyzed using LC-MS/MS to determine if the compound is present in the original plant material (34). -->

<!-- Steam distillation is used when the compounds of interest are volatile, mainly in the preparation of fragrance and flavoring agents (66). SFE using carbon dioxide as the extraction solvent shows great promise as a “green alternative” to conventional extraction methods, because it uses an essentially nontoxic solvent, exhibits minimal potential for artifact formation, and CO2 can be obtained in high purity suitable for production of food-grade extracts (see Chap. 3). The addition of polarity modifiers such as EtOH, and the development of SFE equipment capable of producing pressures in excess of 600 bar, have made possible the extraction of some compounds of intermediate polarity, but polar compounds, including those with phenolic and glycosidic groups, are still poorly extracted (67). For this reason, SFE is too selective for use in general extractions of plant material for bioassay-guided isolation. -->


<!-- After sample collection, all steps of sample storage and handling must be specially monitored to prevent unreliable data.
Samples are generally stored at -80°C to reduce thermal degradation risk [9].
Multiple freeze-thaw cycles could also modify the metabolome and should be controlled for all samples to avoid bias in dataset.
For biological matrices containing enzymes such as plasma or serum, a metabolism-quenching step is mandatory to inhibit activity and reflect in vivo conditions [7].
Sample preparation is dependent on metabolomic approach, sample type and analytical platform. 
For global metabolite profiling, minimum sample preparation is preferred for biofluids to minimize sample modification or metabolite degradation and ensure fast and simple procedures [10].
Sample preparation must be non-selective to match with the wide variety of physicochemical properties of the thousands of compounds present in biofluids [11, 12].
Concerning targeted approach, sample preparation can be adapted to specific analytes, group/class of molecules or metabolic pathways of interest, thus ensuring sample clean-up.
In every case, sample preparation must guarantee the samples compatibility and stability toward the chosen analytical platform.
Metabolomics deals with a very large range of matrices and several adapted sample preparation strategies. -->
