## Preparative Techniques {#sec:prep}

Figure @fig:intro-metabolomes introduces the concept of *metabolome*\footnotemark{}, the final object of the comprehensive chemical study of plants.
\footnotetext{This concept will be discussed later.}
Figure @fig:intro-metabolomes will be used to guide the reading, detailing the main techniques and methods linked to each symbolic *metabolome* level, with some different *metabolome* sub-levels illustrated in the same way (e.g., *enriched metabolome*, *artifacted metabolome*, *colored metabolome*).

![**Author's view of different symbolic levels of the metabolome.**](images/intro-metabolomes.pdf "intro-metabolomes"){#fig:intro-metabolomes short-caption="Author's View of Different Symbolic Levels of the Metabolome" align="center" width="100%"}

The *plant metabolome* represents the first level.
The word *metabolome* was introduced in 1998 [@doi:10/fkzwzj].
As a first approximation, the metabolome corresponds to all small molecules, often termed metabolites, that can be found in an organism.
The «*real*» metabolome is an abstract notion and is not accessible, only partial and time-limited views of its composition can be obtained.

The second level is the *extracted metabolome*.
It represents all metabolites that chemists can to extract from the plant.
Comprehensive extraction of a broad range of metabolites requires the use of multiple extraction techniques, often unfeasible for large experiments and restricted amounts of the biological matrix.

The third level corresponds to the *detected metabolome*.
Only a portion of what has been extracted can be detected by modern instruments.
The *detected* portion of the *extracted* metabolome varies depending on the technology(ies) used for the analyses.

Furthermore, only a portion of the *detected metabolome* can be *qualified*, and an even smaller portion *quantified* with sufficient confidence.
This confidence depends heavily on the method used.
For example, for accurate quantification, targeted methods need to be used.

Targeted methods, because they only consider a restricted set of metabolites, rely on the assumption that the knowledge about metabolites and the respective pathways in which they are involved is complete.

Untargeted methods, on the other hand, attempt to analyze all metabolites.
They can capture information about metabolites produced by a specific organism under a specific condition and make assumptions about unknown metabolites.
Thus, untargeted approaches offer additional qualitative information that is lost by targeted approaches but cannot completely replace them.

The classical reductionist approach used in analytical chemistry starts from the least targeted approach possible to finally lead to highly targeted analyses.
In this process, the restriction consists in selecting samples that are (ideally) representative of a given organism, at a given time, under a given condition.
What is often called *the metabolome* of an organism corresponds often to a time-restricted view of the metabolic composition in a specific situation. 
An additional restriction of the original metabolome occurs during the extraction process.
Before extracting the extracted metabolome, the first necessary step is to identify and collect the plant material [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

### The *Sampled Metabolome*

Usually, during the plant collection, an always rarer experienced botanist or taxonomist [@doi:10.1038/471037d; @doi:10.1525/bio.2011.61.12.4; @doi:10.1186/1742-9994-8-25] is needed to identify the sample.
To help experts in verifying the identification, and as a permanent scientific archive, voucher specimens should be deposited in herbaria, including at least one major institution [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

Depending on the type of study, caution should be given to the number of samples collected.
The sample size is a key factor for later statistical treatment [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbu052; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-338]. 
Moreover, multiple plant parts should be collected to ensure that the extracts prepared are representative of the range of metabolites produced by the plant [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323], as it is known that composition can vary greatly depending on the organs, or depending on external (a)biotic or factors [@doi:10.1080/0735-260291044269].

Except for applications such as flower volatiles, it is rare to directly extract the fresh plant material.
Therefore, the plant material is usually dried and ground (coarsely, not until a powder is obtained).
Even if often disregarded, these steps heavily influence the content of the sample.
For example, high amounts of organic acids are released from cellular compartments during grinding, which can lead to hydrolysis reactions [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

### The *Extracted Metabolome*

#### The *Solvated Metabolome*

Different techniques of extraction exist [@doi:10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.01.014], varying in cost and level of complexity.
The most used in [NP](#np) chemistry consists in placing the dried and ground sample in a solvent for a given time.
The constituents diffuse from the sample to the solvent, until saturation.
In the case of large drug discovery campaigns, this step is usually performed with a succession of different solvents, to encompass a broad range of polarity.
The general protocol used to generate specialized metabolites-rich extracts consists of an initial defatting step, removing non-polar constituents [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323]. 
Then, eventually, a second partition step removes the very polar constituents. 
The resulting extract is best tailored for screening against cell lines, in vivo systems, and enzyme-based assays [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

#### The *Enriched Metabolome*

The extract can be selectively enriched in specific compounds, either directly during the extraction step, or afterward.
This is one of the reasons alkaloids are heavily studied in [NP](#np) chemistry.
As they contain basic amines, they can be easily selectively extracted with sequential acid-base extractions [@doi:10.1385/1-59259-955-9:323].

Another way to selectively enrich parts of the metabolome is through solid phase extraction ([SPE](#spe)).
It will be detailed in Section @sec:intro-chrom.

##### The *Non-interfering Metabolome*

While enriching specific metabolites can be part of the sample preparation, depleting others can be considered as its counterpart.
Multiple [NP](#np)s are known to interfere with biological assays [@doi:10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b00947; @doi:10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01009] and are therefore frequently depleted during sample preparation.

One of the most notable examples is curcumin [@doi:10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00975].
Some receptor-binding assays are also known to be heavily influenced by the fatty acids content [@doi:10.1211/0022357991777092; @doi:10.1021/np000620d].
Additional examples are plant pigments [@doi:10/d46x64; @doi:10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00005] or tannins [@doi:10.1055/s-0029-1234876].

#### The *Artifacted Metabolome*

The extraction and enrichment steps can often lead to additional unwanted compounds in the extracted sample.
These compounds can come from solvent and container impurities, or different types of reactions.
One of the most complete lists to date has been issued in [@isbn:9780080858494].
The previously mentioned alkaloids, for example, can react with highly reactive phosgene created from the chloroform used for extraction and then combine with alcohols of the solvent [@doi:10.3109/10242420109003642; @pmid:6130900]
Among the other known important reactions, isomerization processes and ways to prevent them are well described [@doi:10/bsv96j].

Finally, it is to be noted that plasticizers, mainly phthalates are almost always contaminating samples, with some cases representing more than half of the extracted mass [@doi:10.1186/2008-2231-21-43].
While this could seem a relatively easy issue to solve, studies showed the ability of certain organisms to produce phthalates [@doi:10.1074/JBC.M109811200], thus making it more challenging to discriminate extraction artifacts from compounds present *in situ*.

#### The *Separated Metabolome* (Chromatography) {#sec:intro-chrom}

The last preparative technique used in phytochemistry is chromatography, used to separate the compounds based on their physicochemical properties.
Depending on the separated amounts, it corresponds to *preparative* or *analytical* chromatography.
The chromatographic step(s) can be performed at different stages of the analysis, the main ones being detailed below.

Historically, in [NP](#np) chemistry, chromatography was performed with open-column chromatography packed with silica gel [@isbn:978-0-08-085817-3].
It was first used to separate plant pigments, the reason why it is named so, as bands of different colors appeared during the very first experiments.
The principle of chromatography is an interplay between the analyte, the stationary phase, and 
the mobile phase.
The mobile phase can either remain stable (isocratic mode) or change gradually (gradient mode).

Over the years, with the same principle, this separation technique evolved into more efficient, miniaturized setups.
The first improvement was made by thin layer chromatography ([TLC](#tlc)) [@doi:10/frhkgg].
[TLC](#tlc) was then further improved with the use of particles of silica of smaller size, leading to high-performance ([HP](#hp))[TLC](#tlc) [@doi:10.1021/ac902945t].
These techniques are still used today in phytochemistry.

The same stationary phases used in ([HP](#hp))[TLC](#tlc) can also be used for pre-concentration techniques such as [SPE](#spe) (often use for pesticide [@doi:10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.01.024] or xenobiotic residues [@doi:10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.10.051] analysis) and vacuum liquid chromatography ([VLC](#vlc)).
Their use varies depending on the amounts, as [SPE](#spe) allows only for small amounts of extract to be concentrated while [VLC](#vlc) allows for more.
The possibility to separate higher amounts comes at the expense of a lower resolution.
In chromatography, the resolution is expressed in *theoretical plates* for the isocratic mode and in *peak capacity* for the gradient mode.

The above-mentioned preparative techniques are usually not coupled to any detector.
Preparative techniques that can be coupled to a direct detection are Medium Pressure [LC](#lc) ([MPLC](#mplc)), preparative High-Performance [LC](#lc) ([HPLC](#hplc)), and now even preparative Ultra High-Performance [LC](#lc) ([UHPLC](#uhplc)).
Other chromatographic techniques (e.g., Gas chromatography ([GC](#gc)), supercritical fluid chromatography) can be coupled directly to detectors, but as they were not used in this work, they will not be detailed.
As mentioned previously, the difference comes from the size, shape, and amount of the stationary phase.

It should be noted that in addition to the particle size of the stationary phase, its chemistry can also vary considerably, allowing for multiple types of interaction with the analytes.
Particle size will impact resolution, while the chemistry of the stationary phase will retain analytes differently.
The two mostly used stationary phases in [LC](#lc) are C~18~, or reversed phase (mainly for apolar compounds), and Hydrophilic Interaction [LC](#lc) ([HILIC](#hilic)) (mainly for polar compounds).
One of the reasons for this choice is that the solvents usually used with these stationary phases are compatible with current the ion sources used in [LC](#lc)-[MS](#ms), which facilitates the on-line coupling of chromatographic methods with the detector.
