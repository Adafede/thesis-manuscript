# Linking Comprehensive Compositional Assessment to Bioactivity {#sapid .page_break_before}

## Foreword {.unnumbered}

As announced earlier, the *comprehensive compositional assessment* was developed not only to get the best possible view of the composition, but also to estimate the relative quantity of the annotated metabolites.
This is of particular relevance for bioactivity evaluation.

The following chapter illustrates how compositional data obtained with the methods presented in the previous chapters can be linked to bioactivity data.

First, this link could be illustrated in an article published in the *Journal of Natural Products* [@doi:10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c00146], in collaboration with the University of Basel.

The abstract of this co-authored article is available in Appendix @sec:melanoma.

A second, more complex approach was developed to assess the taste contribution of chemical compounds found in *S. chirayita*, presented in Chapter @sec:cascade.
Due in part to restrictions on tastings during the pandemic, this chapter presents only preliminary results.
Further research will be needed to fully understand the complex mechanisms behind the extract's unique bitter taste.

Part of the content is adapted from a poster presented in 2021-09, at the 69th International Congress and Annual Meeting of the Society for Medicinal Plant and Natural Product Research, online [@doi:10.1055/s-0041-1736968].
