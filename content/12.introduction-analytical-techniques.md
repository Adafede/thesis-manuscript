## Analytical Techniques{#anal}

Figure @fig:intro-metabolomes introduces the concept of *metabolome*\footnotemark{}.
\footnotetext{This concept will be discussed later.}
It will be used to guide the reading, detailing the main techniques linked to each *metabolome* level.

The *plant metabolome* represents the first level.
It consists of all chemical compounds found inside the plant.
In reality, these chemicals can originate from other sources, such as endophytes present inside the plant.

The second level is the *extracted metabolome*.
It represents all chemicals that chemists are able to extract from the plant.
While not everything is extracted, it is to be noted that some additional chemicals, not originally present in the plant, are also produced during this step.

The third level corresponds to the *detected metabolome*.
After extraction, only a part of what has been extracted can be detected by modern instruments.
This part varies depending on the technology(ies) used for the analyses.

Furthermore, only a portion of the *detected metabolome* can be *qualified*, and an even smaller portion *quantified* with sufficient confidence.
