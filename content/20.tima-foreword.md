Explain why taxo

As explained previously, confident metabolite annotation remains a challenge in plants metabolomics.
In this chapter, an original method to improve confidence in metabolite annotation is presented.
This method consists in the attribution of a score reflecting the taxonomic distance between the biological source studied and the one(s) where the candidate structures were reported.
This chapter is based on a research article published during the thesis [@doi:10.3389/fpls.2019.01329]. 
This chapter has been reformatted, without content changes to the published version.
Some additional information not contained in the original article is available as *[Addendum](#addendum-tima)*.
All references are compiled in the end of the thesis manuscript.
