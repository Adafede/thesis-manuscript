# Taxonomically Informed Metabolite Annotation {#sec:tima .page_break_before}

## Foreword {.unnumbered}

As explained previously, confident metabolite annotation remains a challenge in plants metabolomics.
In this chapter, an original method to improve confidence in metabolite annotation is presented.
This method consists in the attribution of a score reflecting the taxonomic distance between the biological source studied and the one(s) where the candidate structures were reported.
The reasoning behind this method is illustrated in Figure @fig:tima-0.

Figure @fig:tima-0 is adapted from a talk given at the 1st GNPS user meeting (see [Additional Publications & Contributions - Talks](#talks)).
