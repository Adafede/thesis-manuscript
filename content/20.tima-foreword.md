# Taxonomically Informed Metabolite Annotation {#sec:tima .page_break_before}

## Foreword {.unnumbered .unlisted}

As explained previously, confident metabolite annotation remains a challenge in plants metabolomics.
In this chapter, an original method to improve confidence in metabolite annotation is presented.
This method consists in the attribution of a score reflecting the taxonomic distance between the biological source studied and the one(s) where the candidate structures were reported.
The reasoning behind this method is illustrated in Figure @fig:tima-0.

Figure @fig:tima-0 is adapted from a talk given at the 1st [GNPS](#gnps) user meeting (see [Oral Communications](#oral-communications)).

The metabolites that can be produced by an organism are largely governed by its genetics, itself influenced by the environment [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a019315].
Therefore, genome mining appears ideal to link with [NP](#np)s [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkr466; @doi:10.3390/md18040199; @doi:10.1039/D1NP00032B; @doi:10.1016/j.xplc.2022.100300].
However, the genome of only some organisms is easily accessible.
Therefore, the taxonomic position of an organism on the tree of life seems to be a good indicator of its genetic, and therefore metabolic, capacity.

This chapter is based on a research article published during the thesis [@doi:10.3389/fpls.2019.01329]. 
This chapter has been reformatted, without content changes to the published version.
Some additional information not contained in the original article is available as *[Addendum](#addendum-tima)*.
All references are compiled in the end of the thesis manuscript.
