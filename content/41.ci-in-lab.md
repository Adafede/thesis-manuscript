## Data Acquisition {.page_break_before}

In order to evaluate the analytical and annotation methods used routinely in the laboratory and in the frame of this thesis, a mixture of five well-studied plants coming from the European pharmacopeia (*Arnica montana* L., *Cinchona pubescens* Vahl, *Ginkgo biloba* L., *Panax ginseng* C. A. Meyer and *Salvia officinalis* L.) was used as a benchmark.
For the rest of this chapter, it will be named *QCmix* (for *Q*uality *C*ontrol *mix*ture). 

It has permitted, among other projects, to improve the acquisition parameters to maximize the quantity and quality of the [MS/MS](#msms) spectra recorded by the internal [HR](#hr)-[MS/MS](#msms) platform.

Here after are some examples of parameters that were optimized and the results of such optimization.

### Acquisition Range

While untargeted metabolomics aims to acquire information on the broadest possible range of metabolites, it would appear logical that the wider the acquisition range, the broader the coverage.
This, however, did not hold true, as illustrated in Figure @fig:ci-1.

![**Comparison of the same sample acquired with two acquisition ranges.** The blue chromatogram ([MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2)) scans) was acquired from 100 to 1500 [*m/z*](#mz), the red one from 150 to 1500.](images/ci-1.pdf "ci-1"){#fig:ci-1 short-caption="Comparison of the Same Sample Acquired With Two Acquisition Ranges" align="center" width="100%"}

The blue chromatogram was acquired between 100 and 1500 [*m/z*](#mz) and the red one between 150 and 1500 [*m/z*](#mz).
The sample used for acquisition is the one described in Chapter @sec:cascade.
While this definitely hampered the acquisition of small metabolites with [MW](#mw) lower than 150Da, it allowed acquiring more relevant signals.
This was because of the unequal repartition of contaminants and solvent carriers.
They were mainly present below 120 [*m/z*](#mz), as the ion 102.0346 in Figure @fig:ci-1.
Therefore, the standard acquisition range was set from 120 to 1500 [*m/z*](#mz), as the best compromise to avoid low [MW](#mw) carriers and still acquire compounds with [MW](#mw) >120.

If this strategy was applicable for the compounds present in this range, other contaminants remained and therefore required the use of exclusion lists, as described below. 

### Exclusion Lists

Exclusion lists are the third rule of "successful data-dependent acquisition" [@doi:10.1002/mas.21715].
Therefore, exclusion lists were created based on ions acquired when running solvent blanks.
Each of the most used solvents in the laboratory ([ACN](#acn), [DMSO](#dmso), [EtOH](#etoh), H~2~O, and [MeOH](#meoh)) was injected six times and ions for which an [MS^2^](#ms2) spectrum was acquired at least five times out of the six were placed on the exclusion list.
The result of the acquisition with and without exclusion list is illustrated in Figure @fig:ci-2.

![**[MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2) Chromatograms of the same sample acquired with and without exclusion list.** Panel A illustrates [MS](#ms)^1^ chromatograms of both samples. Panel B illustrates the [MS^2^](#ms2) chromatogram](images/ci-2.pdf "ci-2"){#fig:ci-2 short-caption="Chromatograms of the Same Sample Acquired With and Without Exclusion List" align="center" width="100%"}

The data were acquired on the *QCmix*.
No difference between the acquisition with (dark blue) and without (light blue) exclusion list can be observed at the [MS](#ms)^1^ level (panel A).
At the [MS^2^](#ms2) level (panel B), the acquisition is more focused on peaks originating from the sample.
This can be observed on the large DMSO injection peak.
Without an exclusion list, even if excluded by the dynamic exclusion list for some seconds, DMSO occupied most of the scans.
This is not the case on the dark blue trace.
A zoom illustrating the impact on zones with minor signals is also given.
Between 5 and 6 minutes, some minor signals were lost without exclusion list, as they were below the level of carriers originating from the solvent.
A more detailed evaluation will be presented in Table @tbl:ci-1, after optimization of some of the remaining parameters.

### Other Parameters

In addition to acquisition range and exclusion lists, some more instrument-specific parameters were investigated.
The survey was conducted on a Q-Exactive Focus, where the strongest limiting factor is the scanning frequency of 12 Hz.
The main investigated parameters were the `ACG Target` (for both [MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2)), the `Maximum Ion Time` (for both [MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2)), and the `Dynamic Exclusion`, also described as impactful parameters in [@doi:10.1002/mas.21715].

Concerning the `ACG Target`, it would be ideal to fill the C-trap with a maximum of ions to get the best possible quality of spectra.
While this seems desirable, it comes with two disadvantages.
First, if set too high, the `ACG Target` will take a long scan time to be reached, thus limiting the acquisition of other scans.
Second, and more importantly, the pre-scan time will also increase for higher `ACG Target`.
Therefore, it was set relatively low, with a factor of 10 between [MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2).

The `ACG Target` can be balanced with the `Maximum Ion Time`. 
Indeed, if the `ACG Target` is still not reached after the `Maximum Ion Time`, the next iteration will occur.
As the extracts analyzed in the laboratory were rich, the challenge resides more on the side of being able to acquire a maximum of signals, and not necessarily acquiring good spectral data on regions with almost no signal, as they are rare.
For this reason, the `Maximum Ion Time` was set to the length of the transients minus the time lost because of internal calculation.
The calculation time lost per scan was approximately 9ms.
The transient lengths on quadrupole-Orbitrap for resolutions of 17,500 and 35,000 are 64ms and 128ms at [*m/z*](#mz) 200, respectively [@doi:10.1074/mcp.O112.019802].
Therefore, the `Maximum Ion Time` was set to 119ms and 55ms for [MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2), respectively.
To compensate for the relatively small `Maximum Ion Time`, the `Dynamic Exclusion` was set to 2s, to acquire multiple fragmentation spectra on large peaks, and therefore increase the chances to have a good quality merged fragmentation spectrum.

An increase in the scanning frequency was of course interesting but often obtained at the expense of spectral quality.
Therefore, not only the number of spectra but also metrics reflecting spectral quality will be discussed.
To the best of our knowledge, no common metrics to assess spectral quality are available and their development should be of interest to the community.
The impact of the optimization of the parameters was evaluated with the standard downstream processing performed in the laboratory, mainly through [MN](#mn)-based exploration.

### Evaluation Through Annotated Molecular Network

Part of the [MN](#mn) resulting from the optimization of the above presented parameters is shown in Figure @fig:ci-3 and main metrics associated with it are given in Table @tbl:ci-1.

![**Cluster Containing Cinchona Alkaloids Before and After Optimization.** The cluster after optimization contains more nodes and annotations (in blue).](images/figure-tac-1.pdf "ci-3"){#fig:ci-3 short-caption="Cluster Containing Cinchona Alkaloids Before and After Optimization" align="center" width="100%"}

Figure @fig:ci-3 shows a cluster containing cinchona alkaloids before and after optimization.
The number of nodes and unique library hits increased from 57 to 85 and 3 to 10, respectively.
Moreover, nodes are more connected, leading to increased [centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality).
While centrality is used from many years in social sciences [@doi:10/bx3m36], it is still poorly if not used at all in [MN](#mn) analysis.
More detailed metrics concerning the whole [MN](#mn), and not only the cinchona alkaloid cluster are presented in Table @tbl:ci-1.

|**Observed variable (n=3)**     |**Before optimization**  |**After optimization**   |**Increase**|
|:-------------------------------|------------------------:|------------------------:|----------:|
|**Total scans, [NI](#ni)**       | 4,468 ± 6              | 4,917 ± 5               | **10%**  |

First, the number of features (corresponding to a [*m/z*](#mz) at a given retention time) [@doi:10.3390/metabo8020031] and their associated tandem [MS](#ms) spectrum (or spectra) obtained after data treatment increased.
Those features were used to generate a [MN](#mn) (cf. Figure @fig:ci-3).
[MN](#mn) clusters [MS/MS](#msms) spectra together and connect them with edges.
The measure of the number of edges per node in the resulting [MN](#mn) was highly interesting as it indicated that spectra shared more similarity after the optimization stage.
In this sense, a better quality of tandem [MS](#ms) spectra was probably achieved.
This was also reflected in the percentage of connected nodes within the network (approximately + 25%), facilitating further exploration.
Finally, the annotation rate (nodes in blue in Figure @fig:ci-3) also increased, suggesting that the new acquisition method was able, either to acquire more signals, or acquire more informative spectra, or both.
The next subchapter will discuss the improvements related to data annotation.

## Data Annotation

Improvements to the annotation tools used in the laboratory are described hereafter.
Improvements made to [TIMA](#tima) and LOTUS will be described in dedicated subchapters.

This part is related to the improvements brought to the [ISDB](#isdb), initially described by Pierre-Marie Allard in 2016 [@doi:10.1021/ACS.ANALCHEM.5B04804].

### Spectral Library Builder

Even if routinely used in the laboratory, the [ISDB](#isdb) received only three major updates [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5607186; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.5607264; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.6939173].
The initial version, made from the structures from the [UNPD](#unpd), contained over 170,000 spectra computed with [CFM](#cfm) 2 [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01622; @doi:10.1007/s11306-014-0676-4].
Spectra were only available in [PI](#pi) (some internal trials with [NI](#ni) were made but never made public).
It was then updated, still in [PI](#pi) mode, using structures from [COCONUT](https://coconut.naturalproducts.net/) [@doi:10.1186/s13321-020-00478-9] and [CFM](#cfm) 3 [@doi:10.3390/metabo9040072].
To facilitate downstream steps, headers of the resulting MGF file contained some additional metadata.
This work was still performed by Pierre-Marie Allard.

Taking advantage of the developments brought by the *Lotus initiative*, a new version of the [ISDB](#isdb) was released, this time in both [PI](#pi) and [NI](#ni), using all the structures curated by LOTUS [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.6378223].
The spectra were computed using [CFM](#cfm) 4 [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01465].
All related code is available and the main steps are documented at <https://github.com/mandelbrot-project/spectral_lib_builder>.
This version contains the spectra of over 270,000 unique [2D](#dd) structures.

An example of the difference between the spectra predicted by [CFM](#cfm) 3 and [CFM](#cfm) 4 is illustrated in Figure @fig:ci-4.

![**Comparison of experimental and predicted spectra for the [2D](#dd) structure of quassin.** The blue spectra correspond to an experimental spectrum of IOSXSVZRTUWBHC (accessible with [splash10-0a4l-0494000000-ae9ea734cc050a768b8a](https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/spectra/browse?query=splash.splash%3D%3D%22splash10-0a4l-0494000000-ae9ea734cc050a768b8a%22)), and red spectra to the predicted spectra of the corresponding structure. Panel A corresponds to the spectrum predicted with [CFM](#cfm) 3 and panel B to the one predicted with [CFM](#cfm) 4.](images/ci-4.pdf "ci-4"){#fig:ci-4 short-caption="Comparison of Experimental and Predicted Spectra for the [2D](#dd) Structure of Quassin" align="center" width="100%"}

On panel A, the most intense fragment in the experimental spectrum of the [2D](#dd) structure of quassin (IOSXSVZRTUWBHC, accessible with [splash10-0a4l-0494000000-ae9ea734cc050a768b8a](https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/spectra/browse?query=splash.splash%3D%3D%22splash10-0a4l-0494000000-ae9ea734cc050a768b8a%22) [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3689]) is not matched to any predicted fragment (with a tolerance of 0.01Da).
It is matched on panel B, where 126 peaks are matched in total, in comparison to the 108 matched in panel A.
More globally, the predicted intensities reflect better the experimental ones on panel B.
The modified cosine similarity between the experimental spectrum and the [CFM](#cfm) 3 predicted spectrum was 0.06 and increased to 0.16 with [CFM](#cfm) 4.
The next subchapter will discuss spectral similarity measures and their impact on annotations more in depth.

### Spectral Library Matcher

The initial [ISDB](#isdb) workflow was based on the spectral library search tool Tremolo [@doi:10.1021/pr400230p], working only on Linux.
Multiple steps were then needed to add metadata, originally coming from closed resources.
All these aspects made the workflow inaccessible to many non-expert users.
This process was greatly improved thanks to the introduction of matchms [@doi:10.21105/joss.02411].
The matchms library allowed building a new version of the previous spectral matching step.
This version was a joint effort with multiple objectives.
First, it made the spectral matching step available to all platforms, and not to Linux only.
Second, it was packaged as a python library, that can be easily installed for non-advanced users.
Finally, in addition to being faster than the original version, it came with some advanced metadata in the headers and new functionalities.

Among the new functionalities, the possibility to compute other spectral similarity metrics than the modified cosine was added.
Currently implemented similarity metrics are: `ModifiedCosine` (used in many workflows, such as [GNPS](#gnps)), `MS2DeepScore` [@doi:10.1186/s13321-021-00558-4], and `Spec2Vec` [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008724].

An overview of the performance of those similarity metrics on a benchmarking set of 22,388 features originating from <https:doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5186176> [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5186176] against the last version of the [ISDB](#isdb) is illustrated in Figure @fig:ci-5.

![**Performance of the different similarity metrics on the benchmarking set.** On panel A, the densities of the scores obtained by each method are illustrated (the correct annotations are in blue, the incorrect in red). On panel B, the densities of the obtained ranks are illustrated.](images/ci-5.pdf "ci-5"){#fig:ci-5 short-caption="Performance of the Different Similarity Metrics on the Benchmarking Set" align="center" width="100%"}

In Figure @fig:ci-5, the repartitions of the scores of the incorrect annotations with the `ModifiedCosine` and the `Spec2Vec` methods were good.
This was not the case with the ones of `MS2DeepScore`, which have rather high similarity scores.
In contrast, the scores of the correct annotations were the highest using `MS2DeepScore`, were relatively normally distributed using `Spec2Vec`, and were almost random using the `ModifiedCosine` method.
This was also reflected in the ranks distributions.
While the `MS2DeepScore` method had the most desirable distribution for the correct annotations, it had a bad discriminating power, with a high proportion of incorrect annotations also ranked best.
More detailed statistics are presented in Table @tbl:ci-2.

Table: Main Statistics of the Different Similarity Metrics {#tbl:ci-2}

|**Observed variable**                     |**Modified Cosine**  |**MS2DeepScore** |**Spec2Vec**|
|------------------------------------------|--------------------:|----------------:|-----------:|
|**Mean spectral score (correct)**         | 0.35                | 0.69            | 0.33       |
|**Mean spectral score (incorrect)**       | 0.14                | 0.57            | 0.18       |
|**Median spectral score (correct)**       | 0.28                | 0.71            | 0.33       |
|**Median spectral score (incorrect)**     | 0.05                | 0.58            | 0.17       |
|**Mean rank (correct)**                   | 21                  | 28              | 22         |
|**Median rank (correct)**                 | 5                   | 9               | 5          |

As explained above, none of the methods gave satisfactory results alone (only half of the correct annotations are in the top five candidates at best).
An illustration of how the improved version of the [TIMA](#tima) can help in improving the rankings will be given in the next subchapter.

Other similarity metrics were proposed recently, such as spectral entropy [@doi:10.1038/s41592-021-01331-z], `SIMILE` [@doi:10.1038/s41467-022-30118-9], and `GLEAMS` [@doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01496-1].

Even if not implemented yet, the current architecture of the spectral library matcher (available at <https://github.com/mandelbrot-project/spectral_lib_matcher>) is expected to support those new metrics.
As it is still widely used and recently proven to outperform other metrics [@doi:10.1021/jasms.2c00153], the `ModifiedCosine` method is still used by default.
