Describe QCmix

In order to evaluate the analytical and annotation methods used in the lab, a mixture of five well studied plants coming from the European pharmacopeia (*Arnica montana* L., *Cinchona pubescens* Vahl, *Ginkgo biloba* L., *Panax ginseng* C. A. Meyer and *Salvia officinalis* L.) was used as benchmark.
For the rest of this chapter, it will be named *QCmix* (for *Q*uality *C*ontrol *mix*ture). 

In order to develop a generic metabolite profiling method that would fit a large chemodiverse set of metabolites, the QCmix has been used.
It has permitted, among other projects, to improve acquisition parameters to maximize the number of MS/MS spectra recorded keeping a good spectrum quality.

Increase in the scanning frequency is of course interesting, but often obtained at the expense of spectral quality.
Therefore, not only the number of spectra but also metrics reflecting spectral quality are proposed.
To the best of our knowledge, no common metrics to assess spectral quality are available and their development should be of interest for the community.
First, number of features (corresponding to a *m/z* ratio at a given retention time) [@doi:10.3390/metabo8020031] and their associated tandem MS spectrum obtained after data treatment increase.
Those features are then used to generate MN (cf. Figure 4).
MN cluster MS/MS scans together and connect them with edges.
The measure of the number of edges per node in the resulting MN is highly interesting as it indicates that spectra share more similarity after the optimization stage.
Since it is excluded that this increase in similarity could be coming from noise thanks to the fragmentation technology of Orbitrap and the acquisition mode (DDA), better quality of tandem MS spectrum is probably achieved.
This is also reflected in the percentage of connected nodes within the network (approximatively + 25%), facilitating further exploration.
Further investigations remain to be done and if a good level of correct annotations is obtained with the QCmix through validation by standards, it is foreseen that identification of major constituents in well-studied plants of industrial interest should be achieved.
Since metabolite annotation remains a challenge in plant metabolomics, having a characterized mix that everyone can reproduce by purchasing easily accessible pharmacopeia plants gives the possibility to share it between laboratories for benchmarking metabolite profiling methods and associated workflows.
Additionally, diffusion of a setof raw MS data using a variety of acquisition methods will allow the community to benchmark their annotation approaches on the exact same complex mixtures and compare their respective results.
