## Data Acquisition {.page_break_before}

In order to evaluate the analytical and annotation methods used in the lab, a mixture of five well studied plants coming from the European pharmacopeia (*Arnica montana* L., *Cinchona pubescens* Vahl, *Ginkgo biloba* L., *Panax ginseng* C. A. Meyer and *Salvia officinalis* L.) was used as benchmark.
For the rest of this chapter, it will be named *QCmix* (for *Q*uality *C*ontrol *mix*ture). 

It has permitted, among other projects, to improve the acquisition parameters to maximize the quantity and quality of the [MS/MS](#msms) spectra recorded by the internal [HR](#hr)-[MS/MS](#msms) platform.

Here after are some examples of parameters that were optimized and the results of such optimization.

### Acquisition Range

While untargeted metabolomcis aims to acquire information on the broadest possible range of metabolites, it would appear logical that the wider the acquistion range, the broader the coverage.
This, however, did not hold true, as illustrated in Figure @fig:ci-1.

![**Comparison of the same aample acquired with two acquisition ranges.** The blue chromatogram ([MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2)) scans) was acquired from 100 to 1500 [*m/z*](#mz), the red one from 150 to 1500.](images/ci-1.pdf "ci-1"){#fig:ci-1 short-caption="Comparison of the Same Sample Acquired With Two Acquisition Ranges" align="center" width="100%"}

The blue chromatogram was acquired between 100 and 1500 *m/z* and the red one between 150 and 1500 [*m/z*](#mz).
The sample used for acquisition is the one described in Chapter @sec:cascade.
While this definitely hampered the acquisition of small metabolites with [MW](#mw) lower than 150Da, it allowed to acquire much more relevant signals.
This was because of the unequal repartition of contaminants and solvent carriers.
They were mainly present below 120 [*m/z*](#mz), as the ion 102.0346 on Figure @fig:ci-1.
If this strategy was applicable for the compounds present in this range, other contaminants remained and therefore required the use of exclusion lists, as desribed below. 

### Exclusion Lists

Exclusion lists are the third rule of "successful data-dependent acquisition" [@doi:10.1002/mas.21715].
Therefore, exclusion lists were created based on ions acquired when running solvent blanks.
Each of the most used solvents in the laboratory ([ACN](#acn),[DMSO](#dmso),[EtOH](#etoh),H~2~O, and [MeOH](#meoh)) was injected six times and ions for those an [MS^2^](#ms2) spectrum was acquired at least five times out of the six were placed on the exclusion list.
The result of the acquisition with and without exclusion list is illustrated on Figure @fig:ci-2.

![**[MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2) Chromatograms of the same sample acquired with and without exclusion list.** Panel A illustrates [MS](#ms)^1^ chromatograms of both samples. Panel B illustrates the [MS^2^](#ms2) chromatogram](images/ci-2.pdf "ci-2"){#fig:ci-2 short-caption="Chromatograms of the Same Sample Acquired With and Without Exclusion List" align="center" width="100%"}

The data were acquired on the *QCmix*.
No difference between the acquisition with (dark blue) and without (light blue) exclusion list can be observed at the [MS](#ms)^1^ level (panel A).
At the [MS^2^](#ms2) level (panel B), acquisition is more focused on peaks originating from the sample.
This can be observed on the big DMSO injection peak.
Without exclusion list, even if excluded by the dynamic exclusion list for some seconds, DMSO occupied most of the scans.
This is not the case on the dark blue trace.
A zoom illustrating the imapct on zones with minor signals is also given.
Between 5 and 6 minutes, some minor signals were lost without exclusion list, as they were below the level of carriers originating from the solvent.
A more detailed evaluation will be presented in Table @tbl:ci-1, after optimization of some of the remaining parameters.

### Other Parameters

In complement to acquisition range and exclusion lists, some more instrument-specific parameters were investigated.
The investigation was carried on a Q-Exactive Focus, which strongest limiting factor is the 12Hz scanning frequency.
The main investigated parameters were the `ACG Target` (for both [MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2)), the `Maximum Ion Time` (for both [MS](#ms)^1^ and [MS^2^](#ms2)), the `Dynamic Exclusion`, and the `Expected Peak Width`, also described as impactful parameters in [@doi:10.1002/mas.21715].

Concerning the `ACG Target`, it would be ideal to fill the C-trap with a maximum of ions to get the best possible quality of spectra.
While this seems desirable, it comes with two disadvantages.
First, if set too high, the `ACG Target` will take a long scan time to be reached, thus limiting the acquisition of other scans.

Part of the Molecular Network ([MN](#mn)) resulting from the optimization of the above presented parameters is shown in Figure @fig:ci-3 and main metrics associated with it are given in Table @tbl:ci-1.

Increase in the scanning frequency is of course interesting, but often obtained at the expense of spectral quality.
Therefore, not only the number of spectra but also metrics reflecting spectral quality are proposed.
To the best of our knowledge, no common metrics to assess spectral quality are available and their development should be of interest for the community.
First, number of features (corresponding to a [*m/z*](#mz) at a given retention time) [@doi:10.3390/metabo8020031] and their associated tandem [MS](#ms) spectrum obtained after data treatment increased.
Those features were then used to generate [MN](#mn) (cf. Figure @fig:ci-3, [MN](#mn) clusters [MS/MS](#msms) spectra together and connect them with edges).
The measure of the number of edges per node in the resulting [MN](#mn) was highly interesting as it indicated that spectra shared more similarity after the optimization stage.
In this sense, better quality of tandem [MS](#ms) spectrum was probably achieved.
This was also reflected in the percentage of connected nodes within the network (approximately + 25%), facilitating further exploration.
Finally,

`//TODO`{.red}.

 investigations remain to be done and if a good level of correct annotations is obtained with the QCmix through validation by standards, it is foreseen that identification of major constituents in well-studied plants of industrial interest should be achieved.
Since metabolite annotation remains a challenge in plant metabolomics, having a characterized mix that everyone can reproduce by purchasing easily accessible pharmacopeia plants gives the possibility to share it between laboratories for benchmarking metabolite profiling methods and associated workflows.
Additionally, diffusion of a set of raw [MS](#ms) data using a variety of acquisition methods will allow the community to benchmark their annotation approaches on the exact same complex mixtures and compare their respective results.
