# Continuous Improvement of Acquisition & Annotation Methods {#sec:ci .page_break_before}

## Foreword {.unnumbered}

In 2020 only, over 85 metabolomics resources appeared [@doi:10.1007/s11306-021-01796-1].
With the constant evolution of instrument and tools, keeping acquisition and annotation methods up-to-date is a real challenge.

Chapter @sec:ci illustrates some of the unpublished work that has been done to continuously improve methods used by the laboratory.
One of the major technical improvements, the hyphenation of the [HR](#hr)[MS/MS](#msms) platform with a [CAD](#cad) is described in Chapter @sec:cascade.
Other improvements, based on internal or external pre-existing works are detailed hereafter.

Unpublished improvements made to the works described in the two previous chapters, mainly in terms of usability, are also detailed in dedicated subchapters.
