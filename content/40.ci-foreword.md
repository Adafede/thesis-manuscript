# Continuous Improvement of Acquisition & Annotation Methods {#sec:ci .page_break_before}

## Foreword {.unnumbered .unlisted}

In 2020, over 85 metabolomics resources appeared [@doi:10.1007/s11306-021-01796-1].
The constant evolution of instruments and tools is challenging to keep acquisition and annotation methods up to date.

Chapter @sec:ci illustrates part of the unpublished work that has been done to continuously improve methods used by the laboratory.
One of the major technical improvements, the hyphenation of the [HR](#hr)[MS/MS](#msms) platform with a [CAD](#cad) is described in Chapter @sec:cascade.
Other improvements, based on internal or external pre-existing works are detailed hereafter.
They will first focus on the optimization of data acquisition and then study its impact on downstream processing, mainly data annotation.

Unpublished improvements specifically made to [TIMA](#tima) (see Chapter @sec:tima) are also detailed in dedicated subchapters.
