##### Abstract {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Repurposed drugs have been evaluated for the management of clear cell renal cell carcinoma ([ccRCC](#ccrcc)), but only a few have influenced the overall survival of patients with advanced disease.
To combine repurposed non-oncology with oncological drugs, we applied our validated phenotypic method, which consisted of a reduced experimental part and data modeling.
A synergistic optimized multidrug combination ([ODC](#odc)) was identified to significantly reduce the energy levels in cancer remaining inactive in non-cancerous cells.
The [ODC](#odc) consisted of Rapta-C, erlotinib, metformin and parthenolide and low doses.
Molecular and functional analysis of [ODC](#odc) revealed a loss of adhesiveness and induction of apoptosis.
Gene-expression network analysis displayed significant alterations in the cellular metabolism, confirmed by [LC](#lc)-[MS](#ms) based metabolomic analysis, highlighting significant changes in the lipid classes.
We used heterotypic in vitro [3D](#ddd) co-cultures and ex vivo organoids to validate the activity of the [ODC](#odc), maintaining an efficacy of over 70%.
Our results show that repurposed drugs can be combined to target cancer cells selectively with prominent activity.
The strong impact on cell adherence and metabolism indicates a favorable mechanism of action of the [ODC](#odc) to treat [ccRCC](#ccrcc).
