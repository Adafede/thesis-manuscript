##### Abstract {.unlisted .unnumbered}

*Ginkgo biloba* L. is a widely used botanical material.
An [UHPLC](#uhplc)-[HR](#hr)[MS/MS](#msms) method was developed for analysis of Ginkgo leaves extract, and the specific molecular networking was constructed and the chemical composition was preliminarily dereplicated by [GNPS](#gnps) and [ISDB](#isdb)-[DNP](#dnp).
[MN](#mn) guided isolation was performed by integrating the multiple information of [MN](#mn), and 4 trace monomer compounds were isolated and identified.
Totally 120 compounds were identified or putatively characterized.
[MN](#mn) combined multivariate data analysis were applied in composition differences comparison among three kinds of ginkgo preparations.
Different sources of Ginkgo leaves extract preparation were assessed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition activity by a TPE-based fluorescent probe, and quercitrin, isoquercitrin and rutin belong to flavonoid were screened out may contributed to this activity.
This study explored the potential of [MN](#mn) in comprehensive profiling and trace monomer compounds isolation of nature product and established method in quality control of Ginkgo in both chemical and bioactive perspectives.
