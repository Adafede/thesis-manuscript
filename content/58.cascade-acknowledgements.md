## Acknowledgments {.page_break_before}

I thank Kai DÃ¼hrkop for providing the custom Sirius 5.7.0 build.

I also thank Sascha Bestmann from Thermo Fischer Scientific for valuable help with the CAD installation.

I also thank [caetera](https://github.com/caetera) for the extraction of CAD signal directly during mzML conversion (<https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser/pull/87>).
