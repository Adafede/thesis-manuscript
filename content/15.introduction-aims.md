## Aims of This Work

Plants are full of active molecules that are essential for humans.
Although they have been used for thousands of years, we still have only a limited knowledge of their chemistry.
Yet, knowledge of their chemistry is essential in many ways, both in the field of medicine and nutrition.
Recent technological and methodological improvements based on [MS](#ms) allow the detection of a considerable number of metabolites.
However, the ability to extract knowledge from these complex data is still limited.
For this reason, new solutions need to be developed and made accessible to obtain more biological knowledge from the metabolomic data stream.

In this regard, the aim of this work is to develop and combine analytical and computational [MS](#ms)-based tools for a more thorough characterization of the plant metabolome.
Part of the related improvement is first to be able to estimate the confidence of the structural annotation on the majority of detected metabolites.
Second, approaches to estimate the relative amounts of these metabolites have been developed.
The combination of these qualitative and semi-quantitative approaches aims to obtain the most accurate and comprehensive assessment of the metabolome, allowing to distinguish majority from minority compounds.
Analysis of the data through these two categories (majority and minority) should allow a more relevant view of the composition of an extract for drug discovery purposes and bioactivity assessment in general.
To achieve this, different computational tools, along with analytical improvements were developed for and applied to different case studies.

In Chapter @sec:tima, the *Taxonomically Informed Metabolite Annotation* ([TIMA](#tima)) has been developed to improve annotation by taking into account a bioligical context.
As [TIMA](#tima) requires unrestricted access to resources documenting the biological origin of metabolites, the *Lotus initiative* was created in Chapter @sec:lotus.
This initiative is a cornerstone for the rest of the tools developed in this work.
Its goal is to have access to quality data for natural products, while being able to modify them in a sustainable way.
In Chapter @sec:ci, focus was put on improving data acquisition and preprocessing. 
The combination of Chapters @sec:tima, @sec:lotus, and @sec:ci was intended to improve the confidence in annotations and to have metrics to evaluate it.
The second part of this work, aimed at developing a filter to categorize the compounds according to their relative abundance in the extract and thus be able to integrate generic semi-quantitative data with the previously improved qualitative data from [MS](#ms).
This filter was a combination of analytical and methodological improvements described in Chapter @sec:cascade.
In the last part of this work (Chapter @sec:sapid), the objective was to link these methods to the biological activity results, in order to be able to link as efficiently as possible a biological effect to a given compound or family of compounds.
