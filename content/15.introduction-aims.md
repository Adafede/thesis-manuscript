## Aims of This Work

`//TODO`{.red}.

In phytochemistry and [NP](#np) research, metabolomics has become a key player.
Specifically, untargeted metabolomics methodologies have proven to be indispensable.
Recent technological improvements in sample preparation and mass spectrometry have provided
the means to detect an increasing number of metabolites.
However, the ability to extract biological knowledge out of these data mainly relies on the applied computational analysis.
For that reason, novel algorithms have to be developed to obtain more biological knowledge out of the flood of metabolomics data.
Moreover, the appropriate software tools have to be developed to facilitate the use of these algorithms within the metabolomics community.
