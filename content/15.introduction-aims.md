## Aims of the Thesis

Plants are full of active molecules that are essential for humans.
Although they have been used for thousands of years, we still have only a limited knowledge of their chemistry.
Yet, knowledge of their chemistry is essential in many ways, both in the field of medicine and nutrition.
Recent technological and methodological improvements based on [MS](#ms) allow the detection of a considerable number of metabolites.
However, the ability to extract knowledge from these complex data is still limited.
Therefore, new solutions need to be developed and made accessible to obtain more biological knowledge from the metabolomics data stream.

In this regard, the objective of this thesis is to develop and combine analytical and computational tools based on [MS](#ms) for further characterization of the plant metabolome.
Part of the related improvement is first to be able to estimate the confidence of the structural annotation on most of detected metabolites.
Second, approaches to estimate the relative amounts of these metabolites must be developed.
The combination of these qualitative and semi-quantitative approaches is intended to provide the most accurate and comprehensive assessment of the metabolome, allowing for the distinction of major and minor compounds.
Analysis of the data across these two categories (major and minor) should provide a more relevant view of the composition of an extract for drug discovery purposes and bioactivity assessment in general.
To achieve this, different computational tools, as well as analytical improvements, were developed and applied to different case studies.

The first part of the thesis was devoted to structural annotation improvements.
In Chapter @sec:tima, the *Taxonomically Informed Metabolite Annotation* ([TIMA](#tima)) has been developed to improve annotation by considering a biological context.
As [TIMA](#tima) requires unrestricted access to resources documenting the biological origin of metabolites, the *Lotus initiative* was launched and is presented in Chapter @sec:lotus.
This initiative is a cornerstone for the rest of the tools developed in this thesis.
Its goal is to have access to quality data for [NP](#np)s while being able to modify them sustainably through community curation.
In Chapter @sec:ci, the focus was put on improving [LC](#lc)-[MS](#ms) data acquisition and preprocessing. 
The combination of Chapters @sec:tima, @sec:lotus, and @sec:ci was intended to improve the confidence in structural annotations and to have metrics to evaluate it.

The second part of this thesis was aimed at developing a filter to categorize the compounds according to their relative abundance in the extract and thus be able to integrate generic semi-quantitative data with the previously improved qualitative data from [MS](#ms).
This filter is a combination of analytical and methodological improvements described in Chapter @sec:cascade.

Finally, in Chapter @sec:sapid, the objective was to link these methods to biological activity results, to correlate as efficiently as possible a biological effect to a given compound or family of compounds within a given (set of) extract(s).
