TODO chose which one as good compromise

Calculated peak capacity (400g/mol, 40Â°C) (HPLC Calculator version 3.1):

050x2.1x1.7, 07 min 600uL: **199**

050x2.1x1.7, 07 min 900uL: **204**

050x2.1x1.7, 21 min 600uL: **251**

100x2.1x1.7, 21 min 500uL: **307**

150x2.1x1.7, 42 min 400uL: **393**

150x2.1x1.7, 126 min 400uL: **480**

TODO Show increasing peak purity

##### Charged Aerosol Detector (CAD) preprocessing

TODO Small intro

###### Chromatogram pretreatment

As CAD signal is was very noisy, it required some preprocessing steps before peak extraction.
First, a Fourrier transform was performed, to keep only ... TODO
Then, signal was improved as described by TODO et al.
This resulted in a sharper signal, where peak extraction could be performed with better results than on the raw signal.

###### Literature matching

TODO
As an approximation of compounds present in the extracts, a query of reported compounds in the producing organism was performed on Wikidata, which is now the largest occurrences resource for natural products.
The returned list of compounds for each producing organism was then filtered to better match the LC-MS run conditions (see Material and Methods).

Comparison between the composition obtained by LC-MS and the one reported in the literature is illustrated below.
