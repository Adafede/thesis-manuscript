##### Abstract {.unlisted .unnumbered}

*Alzatea verticillata* Ruiz & Pav. (Alzateaceae) is a tropical tree usually found in South America.
It is the only living species of Alzatea genus and the Alzateaceae family, all others being extinct.
With the aim to investigate the possibility to find unusual natural products scaffolds, the chemical content of the dichloromethane and methanolic stems and leaves extracts of *A. verticillata* have been investigated.
Apolar and polar extracts were purified by semi-preparative [HPLC][#hplc] using appropriate stationary phase columns allowing the isolation of 12 compounds, 3 are original natural products described here for the first time.
The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including [NMR](#nmr), [HR](#hr)[MS](#ms) and confirmed by X-ray crystallography.
A [MS](#ms)-based metabolite analysis of the* A. verticillata extracts* was performed by molecular network and additional truxinic acid derivatives were putatively annotated.
