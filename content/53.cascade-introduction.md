## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Recent developments in metabolomics and untargeted LC-MS analyses allow unprecedented qualitative coverage [@doi:10.1038/s41587-020-0740-8].
The automation and throughput of analyses were also dramatically improved [@doi:10.1016/j.cca.2015.08.027]. 
While these developments are crucial for better qualitative characterization of any samples, quantification remains limited to a few compounds [@doi:10.1038/s41598-020-62573-z].
Accurate quantification is a tedious process that requires high quality standards, which makes it unavailable at a large scale [@doi:10.1039/C6AN01753C].
Moreover, even if highly sensitive, LC-MS is not a universal detection technique [@doi:10.1002/mas.20329].
Given the sensitivity reached with modern MS instruments, questions about the relevance of some of the acquired signals exist [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02380].
Indeed, among all signals considered within an LC-MS analysis, the majority are chemical adducts or fragments created during ionization process and one single "analyte" can lead to tenths of features [@doi:10.1002/jms.3345].
This hold particularly true for LC-ESI-MS, where some compounds can exhibit very strong difference in their ionization behaviour [@doi:10.1055/s-0028-1088393].
This is a major drawback of current LC-MS untargeted approaches, as a great portion of the annotated (qualified) signals is not linked to any unbiased semi-quantitative information.
This is even worse for very rich matrices such as plant extracts, as a single analysis can suggest hundreds to thousands of analytes [@doi:10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.01.001], without satisfying means to filter which ones are significant, or do represent an important amount of the extract mass.

Despite many advantages, untargeted LC-MS analyses are still not adopted vastly, because of the inability to decipher relevant information.
Therefore, it appears crucial to develop methodologies to obtain semi-quantitative information on a wide range of signals, rather than on single compounds, as well as estimates of annotation confidence.
A brief overview of the existing solutions for each of these current challenges is presented below.

### Spectral Networking

A major step to decipher the huge data generated by metabolomics approaches was the introduction of Feature-based Molecular Networking (FBMN) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-020-0933-6].
While spectral matching of features to spectral libraries existed from a long time already [@doi:10/d8js78], calculating spectral similarity between features, to organize and visualize them into spectral families greatly facilitated chemical investigation of complex samples [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1203689109].
Further improvements were brought by Ion Identity Networking (IIN) [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-23953-9], and by linking positive and negative ionization modes together [@doi:10.1101/2021.12.21.473622].

### Confidence in Annotation

Possible ways to overcome the latter would be to rapidly estimate the confidence in a given annotation and link it to an approximated quantity.
Recently, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach was developed to estimate the confidence of metabolites absent from spectral libraries [@doi:10.1038/s41587-021-01045-9].
Performance was then further increased using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btac260].
Another complementary way to estimate confidence based on taxonomy has also been internally developed [@doi:10.3389/fpls.2019.01329].
Together, those approaches can facilitate filtering of highly confident annotations only.

### Broader Quantitation

Some approaches tried to address this issue by including optimally selected internal standards of various chemical families to extrapolate ionization of signals attributed to those families [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-8-93].
These approaches remain study specific and still require the use of standards without completely overcoming the intrinsic limitations of ionization.
Therefore, hyphenation with other types of detectors appeared as a way to simultaneously overcome those limitations and capture additional information.
A first improvement was made by the hyphenation of LC-MS platforms with PDA detectors, allowing to record UV spectra [@doi:10.1021/np4004307].
More recently, so-called "universal detectors" such as ELSD [@doi:10.1021/np4009706] and CAD [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.04.047] were introduced to also detect compounds without chromophores.
Such hyphenation exists already for decades in GC field, with GC-FID-MS platforms [@doi:10.1007/s00216-013-6704-9].
While the resolution of GC is intrinsically greater than the one of LC, allowing for such approaches, current UHPLC platforms approach a satisfying peak capacity.
Developments of LC-FID exist, but they did not reach maturity yet, and face multiple challenges related to solvents [@doi:10.1016/j.trac.2018.10.038].

### Aims 

This work thus aims at contextualizing the abundant qualitative information coming from current untargeted LC-MS analyses pipelines and link it to universal semi-quantitative information, together with other orthogonal information.
These developments will help in a contextualized automated assessment of natural extracts, saving human time for more challenging tasks.
We expect this workflow to be particularly useful for registering botanical ingredients, and guide efficient novel NPs isolation.
