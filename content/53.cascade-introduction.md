## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Recent developments in metabolomics and untargeted Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses allow unprecedented qualitative coverage [@doi:10.1038/s41587-020-0740-8].
Automation and throughput of analyses have also been significantly improved [@doi:10.1016/j.cca.2015.08.027]. 
While these developments are crucial for better qualitative characterization of any sample, quantification remains limited to a few compounds [@doi:10.1038/s41598-020-62573-z].
Accurate quantification is a tedious process that requires high-quality standards, making it unavailable on a large scale [@doi:10.1039/C6AN01753C].
Furthermore, although highly sensitive, LC-MS is not a universal detection technique [@doi:10.1002/mas.20329].
Given the sensitivity achieved by modern MS instruments, questions arise about the relevance of some of the acquired signals [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02380].
Indeed, of all the signals considered in an LC-MS analysis, the majority are chemical adducts or fragments created during the ionization process and a single "analyte" can lead to dozens of features [@doi:10.1002/jms.3345].
This is especially true for LC-ESI-MS, where some compounds can exhibit very large differences in their ionization behavior [@doi:10.1055/s-0028-1088393].
This is a major drawback of current untargeted LC-MS approaches, as a large fraction of the annotated (qualified) signals is not linked to any unbiased semi-quantitative information.
This is even worse for very rich matrices such as plant extracts, as a single analysis can suggest hundreds or thousands of analytes [@doi:10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.01.001], without satisfactory means to filter out those that are significant, or that represent a significant amount of the extract mass.

Despite many advantages, untargeted LC-MS analyses are not yet widely adopted, due to the inability to decipher relevant information.
It therefore seems crucial to develop methodologies that provide semi-quantitative information on a wide range of signals, rather than single compounds, as well as estimates of annotation confidence.
A brief overview of current solutions for each of these challenges is presented below.

### Spectral Networking

The introduction of Feature-based Molecular Networking (FBMN) was a major step in deciphering the huge data generated by metabolomic approaches [@doi:10.1038/s41592-020-0933-6].
While spectral matching of features to spectral libraries had already existed for a long time [@doi:10/d8js78], calculating spectral similarity between features to organize and visualize them into spectral families has greatly facilitated the chemical study of complex samples [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1203689109].
Further improvements have been made by Ion Identity Networking (IIN) [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-23953-9], and by linking positive and negative ionization modes [@doi:10.1101/2021.12.21.473622].

### Confidence in Annotation

Possible ways to overcome the latter problem would be to quickly estimate the confidence in a given annotation and relate it to an approximate quantity.
Recently, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach was developed to estimate the confidence of metabolites absent from spectral libraries [@doi:10.1038/s41587-021-01045-9].
The performance was then improved using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btac260].
Another complementary taxonomy-based confidence estimation method was also developed in-house [@doi:10.3389/fpls.2019.01329].
Together, these approaches can facilitate the filtering of highly trusted annotations only.

### Broader Quantitation

Some approaches have attempted to address this problem by including optimally selected internal standards from various chemical families to extrapolate the ionization of signals attributed to these families [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-8-93].
These approaches remain study specific and still require the use of standards without completely overcoming the intrinsic limitations of ionization.
Therefore, the use of hyphenation with other types of detectors has emerged as a way to simultaneously overcome these limitations and capture additional information.
A first improvement was made by coupling LC-MS platforms with PDA detectors, allowing the recording of UV spectra [@doi:10.1021/np4004307].
More recently, so-called "universal" detectors such as ELSD [@doi:10.1021/np4009706] and CAD [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.04.047] have been introduced to detect also compounds without chromophores.
This hyphenation has already existed for decades in the field of gas chromatography (GC), with the GC-FID-MS platforms [@doi:10.1007/s00216-013-6704-9].
Although the resolution of GC is inherently higher than that of LC, allowing for such approaches, current UHPLC platforms have satisfactory peak capacity.
LC-FID developments exist, but are not yet mature, and face multiple solvent-related challenges [@doi:10.1016/j.trac.2018.10.038].

### Aims 

This work therefore aims to contextualize the abundant qualitative information from current untargeted LC-MS analysis pipelines and link it to universal semi-quantitative information, as well as other orthogonal information.
These developments will contribute to an automated comprehensive assesment of natural extracts composition, saving human time on more difficult tasks.
We believe this workflow will be particularly useful for the registration of botanical ingredients and to guide the efficient isolation of new NPs.
