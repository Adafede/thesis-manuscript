## Phytochemistry

Phytochemistry is the study of the chemistry of plants.
Following the work of Sertümer, and thanks to the technical developments mentioned later in the introduction, many other plants have been studied for their chemistry.
This led to the discovery of compounds of importance to humans, some of which will be detailed later.
Because of its two objects of study, phytochemistry is a subcategory of chemistry and botany.

On the chemistry side, the GDB-17 chemical universe database enumerated a chemical space of 166 billion small molecules (organic compounds of intermediate polarity with MW ≤ 500 Da) [@doi:10.1021/ci300415d].
Although these molecules were computer generated and not necessarily observed.
The number of known chemical compounds in PubChem is 111 million [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkaa971].
While almost all of these compounds were generated by combinatorial chemistry, a portion of them were isolated from biological organisms.
Chemicals derived from plants or other biological organisms are often called *Natural Products* (NPs).
There are about 200,000 known NPs, about two-thirds of which are found in plants.
All chemical compounds can be classified into groups, based on different criteria, such as the functional groups they contain.
In the case of NPs, further classification is possible based on the biosynthetic pathway likely used to synthesize the compound.

Biological organisms can also be classified into groups.
Taxonomy describes and circumscribes living organisms in terms of species and organizes them into hierarchical categories called taxa.
There are around 374,000 known, described and accepted plant species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].
Organisms commonly referred to as plants correspond to the taxon Embryophyta. 
Land plants (Embryophyta) are generally divided into non-vascular plants (Bryophyta), or mosses, and vascular plants (Tracheophyta).
However, the chemistry of only a few of these has been studied.
Figure @fig:intro-1 presents an illustration of the Tracheophyta families hierarchically organized according to the Open Tree of Life taxonomy version 3.3 [@doi:10/ggkjbt], as well as the coverage of phytochemical studies conducted to date.

![**Current status of phytochemical knowledge**. Chemically-informed biological trees representing current knowledge of vascular plants (present in the Open Tree of Life taxonomy version 3.3) and their chemistry. In panel A, the families of Tracheophyta are represented. If at least 50 compounds are reported in a family, it is colored. Less than 50% of the families are known to contain at least 50 compounds. In panel B, the genera of the most studied family, Asteraceae, are represented. Only 10% of the genera of Asteraceae are known to contain at least 50 compounds.](images/intro-trees.pdf){#fig:intro-1 short-caption="Current status of phytochemical knowledge" width="95%"}

On both trees, the size of the taxon name is proportional to the number of compounds found in it.
The tree in panel A is composed of 487 families of Tracheophyta, of which 213 (44%) are known to have at least 50 compounds reported.
The family with the most known species is the Orchidaceae, with approximately 28,000 species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].
The family with the most known compounds is the Asteraceae, with about 25,000 compounds, accounting for over 10% of all known plant compounds.
The Asteraceae is also the second largest family in terms of number of species, with about 24,700 species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].

Other families that appear to be well studied are Fabaceae (12,853), Lamiaceae (9,993), Rutaceae (5,780), Apocynaceae (5,539), Euphorbiaceae (4,862), Apiaceae (4,169), Meliaceae (4,112), Solanaceae (3,938) and Rubiaceae (3,466).
The number of known compounds in the Tracheophyta families is available in Appendix @sec:appendix-intro-1.
These families will serve as examples to the next sub-chapter on modern applications of phytochemistry.

It is interesting to note that the most studied plant, the model organism *A. thaliana* (L.) Heynh. (Brassicaceae), is located on a part of the tree whose clades are little studied. 
This illustrates how targeted phytochemical research is.

While 44% coverage of families may seem satisfactory, panel B tempers this claim.
Indeed, even among the most studied plant family (1700 genera), only about 10% (176 genera) of genera are known to contain at least 50 compounds.
Entire areas of the Asteraceae tree are barely studied from a phytochemical point of view, leaving much to be discovered.
Among the Asteraceae, the largest genus in terms of number of species is *Senecio*, with over 1,250 species [@doi:10.2307/25065905].
*Senecio* spp. are known to contain about 1,000 (967) compounds, making it the second most studied genus of Asteraceae, behind *Artemisia*.
*Artemisia* genus is known to contain 2,629 compounds and consist of about 500 species [@doi:10.3109/13880209.2010.497815].
The number of known compounds in the Asteraceae genera is available in Appendix @sec:appendix-intro-2.

*Artemisia* will be the starting point of the next sub-chapter.

### Modern Applications

Among the many successful modern applications of phytochemistry, one of the most notable is the discovery of artemisinin as part of a plant screening research program initiated in 1967 in China.
Tu Youyou's discovery of artemisinin from the leaves of *Artemisia annua* L. in 1972 earned her the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015.
The discovery of Artemisinin and its properties is one of the most successful examples of plant-based drug discovery.
