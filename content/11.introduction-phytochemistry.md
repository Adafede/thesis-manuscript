## Phytochemistry

Phytochemistry is the study of the chemistry of plants.
Following the work of Sertümer, and thanks to the technical developments discussed later in the introduction, many other plants were studied for their chemistry.
This has led to the discovery of compounds important to humans, some of which will be detailed below.

Because of its two objects of study, phytochemistry is a subcategory of both chemistry and botany.

On the chemistry side, the Chemical Universe Database GDB-17 has enumerated a chemical space of 166 billions small molecules (organic compounds of intermediate polarity with MW ≤ 500 Da) [@doi:10.1021/ci300415d].
Although these molecules were computer generated and not necessarily observed.
The number of known chemical compounds in PubChem is 111 million [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkaa971].
While almost all of these compounds were generated by combinatorial chemistry, a portion of them were isolated from biological organisms.
Chemicals derived from plants or other biological organisms are often called *Natural Products* (NPs).
There are about 200,000 known NPs, about two-thirds are found in plants.
All chemical compounds can be classified into groups, based on different criteria, such as the functional groups they contain, for example.
In the case of NPs, an additional classification is possible, based on the biosynthetic pathway probably used by the producing organism to create the compound.

Biological organisms can also be classified into groups.
Taxonomy describes and circumscribes living organisms in terms of species and organizes them into hierarchical categories called taxa.
There are around 374,000 known, described and accepted plant species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].
Organisms commonly named as "plants" correspond to the taxon Embryophyta. 
Land plants (Embryophyta) are usually divided into non-vascular (Bryophyta), or mosses, and vascular plants (Tracheophyta).
However,the chemistry of only a few of them has been studied.
An illustration of the Tracheophyta families hierarchized according to the Open Tree of Life taxonomy version 3.3 [@doi:10/ggkjbt], and the coverage of the phytochemical investigations performed to date is provided in Figure @fig:intro-1.

![**Current status of phytochemical knowledge**. Chemically-informed biological trees representing the current knowledge about vascular plants (present in the Open Tree of Life taxonomy version 3.3) and their chemistry. In panel A, Tracheophyta families are represented. If at least 50 compounds are reported within a family, the family is colored. Less than 50% of the families are known to contain at least 50 compounds. In panel B, the genera of the most studied family, Asteraceae, are represented. Only 10% of the Asteraceae genera are known to contain at least 50 compounds.](images/intro-trees.pdf){#fig:intro-1 short-caption="Current status of phytochemical knowledge" width="95%"}

On both trees, the size of the name of the taxon is proportional to the number of chemical compounds found in it.
The tree in panel A is composed of 487 Tracheophyta families, of which 213  (44%) are known to have at least 50 compounds reported.
The largest family in terms of number of species is Orchidaceae, with around 28,000 species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].
The largest family in terms of number of compounds is Asteraceae, with around 25,000 compounds, which represents more than 10% of all compounds known in plants.
Asteraceae is also the second largest family in terms of number of species, with around 24,700 species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].

Other families which appear as heavily studied are Fabaceae (12,853), Lamiaceae (9,993), Rutaceae (5,780), Apocynaceae (5,539), Euphorbiaceae (4,862), Apiaceae (4,169), Meliaceae (4,112), Solanaceae (3,938), and Rubiaceae (3,466).
A list of the number of compounds known in all Tracheophyta is available at `//TODO`{.red}. // APPENDIX.
These families will serve as notable examples to illustrate the next sub-chapter of modern applications of phytochemistry.

Interestingly, the most studied plant, the model organism *A. thaliana* (Brassicaceae) is located on a portion of the tree which clades are poorly studied. 
This illustrates how targeted (rightly or wrongly) the phytochemical investigations are.

While a coverage of 44% of the families could seem satisfactory, panel B soften this statement.
Indeed, even among the most studied plant family (1700 genera), only about 10% (176 genera) of the genera are known to contain at least 50 compounds.
Entire zones of the Asteraceae tree are barely investigated from a phytochemical point of view,  leaving much to be discovered.
Among Asteraceae, largest genus in terms of number of species is *Senecio*, with more than 1,250 species [@doi:10.2307/25065905].
*Senecio* spp. are known to contain about 1,000 (967) compounds, which makes it the second most studied genus of Asteraceae, behind *Artemisia*.
*Artemisia* spp. are known to contain 2,629 known compounds and consist of around 500 species [@doi:10.3109/13880209.2010.497815].

Artemisia will be the starting point of the nex sub-chapter.
