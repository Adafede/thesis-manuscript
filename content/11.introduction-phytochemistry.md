## Phytochemistry

Phytochemistry is the study of the chemistry of plants.
Following the work of Sertümer, and thanks to the technical developments discussed later in the introduction, many other plants were studied for their chemistry.
This has led to the discovery of compounds important to humans, some of which will be detailed below.

Because of its two objects of study, phytochemistry is a subcategory of both chemistry and botany.

On the chemistry side, the Chemical Universe Database GDB-17 has enumerated a chemical space of 166 billions small molecules (organic compounds of intermediate polarity with MW ≤ 500 Da) [@doi:10.1021/ci300415d].
Although these molecules were computer generated and not necessarily observed.
The number of known chemical compounds in PubChem is 111 million [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkaa971].
While almost all of these compounds were generated by combinatorial chemistry, a portion of them were isolated from biological organisms.
Chemicals derived from plants or other biological organisms are often called *Natural Products* (NPs).
There are about 200,000 known NPs, about two-thirds are found in plants.
All chemical compounds can be classified into groups, based on different criteria, such as the functional groups they contain, for example.
In the case of NPs, an additional classification is possible, based on the biosynthetic pathway probably used by the producing organism to create the compound.

Biological organisms can also be classified into groups.
Taxonomy describes and circumscribes living organisms in terms of species and organizes them into hierarchical categories called taxa.
There are around 374,000 known, described and accepted plant species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].
Organisms commonly named as "plants" correspond to the taxon Embryophyta. 
Land plants (Embryophyta) are usually divided into non-vascular (Bryophyta), or mosses, and vascular plants (Tracheophyta).
However,the chemistry of only a few of them has been studied.
An illustration of the Tracheophyta families hierarchized according to the Open Tree of Life taxonomy version 3.3 [@doi:10/ggkjbt], and the coverage of the phytochemical investigations performed to date is provided in Figure @fig:intro-1.

![**Current status of phytochemical knowledge**. Chemically-informed biological trees representing the current knowledge about vascular plants (present in the Open Tree of Life taxonomy version 3.3) and their chemistry. In panel A, Tracheophyta families are represented. If at least 50 compounds are reported within a family, the family is colored. Less than 50% of the families are known to contain at least 50 compounds. In panel B, the genera of the most studied family, Asteraceae, are represented. Only 10% of the Asteraceae genera are known to contain at least 50 compounds.](images/intro-trees.pdf){#fig:intro-1 short-caption="Current status of phytochemical knowledge" width="95%"}
