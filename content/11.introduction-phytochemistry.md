## Phytochemistry & Human Uses

Phytochemistry is the study of the chemical constituents of plants.
Following the work of Sertümer, and thanks to the technical developments mentioned later in this introduction, many other plants have been studied for their chemical composition.
This led to the discovery of compounds of importance to humans, some of which will be detailed later.
Because of its two objects of study, phytochemistry is a subcategory of chemistry and botany.

On the chemistry side, the GDB-17 chemical universe database enumerated a chemical space of 166 billion small molecules (organic compounds of intermediate polarity with MW ≤ 500 Da) [@doi:10.1021/ci300415d].
GDB-17 was built using up to 17 atoms of C, N, O, S, and halogens.
These molecules were, however, computer-generated and were by far not observed.
The number of known chemical compounds in PubChem, the world's largest collection of freely accessible chemical information, is 111 million [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkaa971].
While almost all of these compounds were generated by combinatorial chemistry, a portion of them were isolated from biological organisms, the NPs.
There are about 200,000 known NPs, about two-thirds of which are found in plants.
All chemical compounds can be classified into groups, based on different criteria, such as the functional groups they contain.
In the case of NPs, further classification is possible based on the biosynthetic pathway likely used to synthesize the compound.

Biological organisms can also be classified into groups.
Taxonomy describes and circumscribes living organisms in terms of species and organizes them into hierarchical categories called taxa.
There are around 374,000 known, described, and accepted plant species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].
Organisms commonly referred to as plants correspond to the taxon Embryophyta. 
Land plants (Embryophyta) are generally divided into non-vascular plants (Bryophyta), or mosses, and vascular plants (Tracheophyta).
However, the chemistry of only a few of these has been studied.
All along the introduction, except otherwise mentioned, information related to chemical compounds found in organisms comes from the *Lotus Initiative* [@doi:10.7554/eLife.70780].
The *Lotus Initiative* and the establishment of the related knowledge base will be detailed in [Chapter 3](#establishment-of-an-open-knowledge-base-for-natural-products-research).

Figure @fig:intro-1 presents an illustration of the Tracheophyta families hierarchically organized according to the Open Tree of Life taxonomy version 3.3 [@doi:10/ggkjbt], as well as the coverage of phytochemical studies conducted to date.

In panel A, the families of Tracheophyta are represented. If at least 50 compounds are reported in a family, it is colored. Less than 50% of the families are known to contain at least 50 compounds. In panel B, the genera of the most studied family, Asteraceae, are represented. Only 10% of the genera of Asteraceae are known to contain at least 50 compounds.](images/intro-trees.pdf){#fig:intro-1 short-caption="Current status of phytochemical knowledge" align="center" width="95%"}

On both trees, the size of the taxon name is proportional to the number of compounds found in it.
The tree in panel A is composed of 487 families of Tracheophyta, of which 213 (44%) are known to have at least 50 compounds reported.
The family with the most known species is the Orchidaceae, with approximately 28,000 species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].
The family with the most known compounds is the Asteraceae, with about 25,000 compounds, accounting for over 10% of all known plant compounds.
The Asteraceae is also the second largest family in terms of number of species, with about 24,700 species [@doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1].

Other families that appear to be well studied are Fabaceae (12,853), Lamiaceae (9,993), Rutaceae (5,780), Apocynaceae (5,539), Euphorbiaceae (4,862), Apiaceae (4,169), Meliaceae (4,112), Solanaceae (3,938) and Rubiaceae (3,466).
The number of known compounds in the Tracheophyta families is available in Appendix @sec:appendix-intro-1.
These families will serve as examples to the next sub-chapter on modern applications of phytochemistry.

Interestingly, the most studied plant, the model organism *A. thaliana* (L.) Heynh. (Brassicaceae), is located on a part of the tree with poorly studied clades (on the left side of the tree, just above the Fabaceae, and below an entire gray area).
This illustrates how targeted phytochemical research is.

While 44% coverage of families may seem satisfactory, panel B tempers this claim.
Indeed, even among the most studied plant family (1700 genera), only about 10% (176 genera) of genera are known to contain at least 50 compounds.
Entire areas of the Asteraceae tree are barely studied from a phytochemical point of view, leaving much to be discovered.
Among the Asteraceae, the largest genus in terms of number of species is *Senecio*, with over 1,250 species [@doi:10.2307/25065905].
*Senecio* spp. are known to contain about 1,000 (967) compounds, making it the second most studied genus of Asteraceae, behind *Artemisia*.
*Artemisia* genus is known to contain 2,629 compounds and consists of about 500 species [@doi:10.3109/13880209.2010.497815].
The number of known compounds in the Asteraceae genera is available in Appendix @sec:appendix-intro-2.

*Artemisia* will be the starting point of the next sub-chapter.

### Pharmacognosy & Drug Discovery

Among the many successful modern applications of phytochemistry, one of the most notable is the discovery of artemisinin as part of a plant screening research program initiated in 1967 in China.
Tu Youyou's discovery of artemisinin from the leaves of *Artemisia annua* L. in 1972 earned her the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015.

Tu Youyou's work is a perfect example of pharmacognosy and the diverse areas it encompasses.
According to the *American Society of Pharmacognosy*, areas included are: "*medicinal properties of natural products, for the purposes of drug discovery and understanding how dietary supplements work (...), analytical methods (...), use of traditional remedies by native cultures (...), evaluation and species verification (...), natural products for specific agricultural purposes (...), novel foods or food ingredients (...), cosmetic application (...), genetic biosynthetic pathways (...)*" [@url:https://www.pharmacognosy.us/what-is-pharmacognosy].
The discovery of Artemisinin and its properties will be used to introduce various notions mentioned above related to pharmacognosy.
Further examples will be used to illustrate complementary aspects of drug discovery

Develop more details

Modern drug discovery is a very expensive process, with an estimated cost of $1.8 billion for a single molecule [@doi:10.1038/nrd3078].
Drug discovery has been heavily influenced by the emergence of genome sequencing.
Genome sequencing has enabled the rapid synthesis and purification of proteins, making testing against single targets possible.
The shift from testing a complex mixture in a complex system to reducing to a single compound against a single target seemed ideal.
Therefore, in the 1990s, combinatorial chemistry began to synthesize myriads of new compounds on the premise that the greater the number of compounds tested, the greater the chance of success.
Combinatorial chemistry was not as successful as expected, mainly because the chemical space generated did not match that of biologically relevant compounds [@doi:10.1038/nrd4510].
Since then, drug discovery has essentially followed two distinct strategies.

The oldest strategy is *phenotypic* drug discovery or classical pharmacology.
In this approach, single extracts or molecules are tested for a given biological activity, with the results measured phenotypically, without prior knowledge of the biological target.
Modern drug discovery by phenotyping is still considered a viable pharmaceutical strategy [@doi:10.1021/jm201649s].

Among notable examples related to Figure @fig:intro-1, reserpin was isolated from *Rauvolfia serpentina* (L.) Benth. ex Kurz (Apocynaceae) by Ciba researchers [@doi:10.1007/BF02174406].
Reserpine was discovered for its sedative effects and was approved in 1955 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hypertension.
Other examples of drugs isolated from the Apocynaceae family are vincristine and vinblastine, two chemotherapies.
Both were isolated from the leaves of *Catharanthus roseus* (L.) G.Don.
The example of *Catharanthus roseus*, traditionally used in Madagascar long before the discoveries of vinblastine and vincristine, raises important questions about intellectual property.
The debate over *"Who Owns Native Culture"* [@isbn:9780674016330] may also partly explain the pharmaceutical industry's disinterest in NPs.
Both are still on the World Health Organization (WHO) [Essential Drugs List](https://list.essentialmeds.org) [@url:https://list.essentialmeds.org].

Another NP present in the WHO essential drug list and produced by one of the well-studied families in Figure @fig:intro-1 is quinine.
Quinine was isolated in 1820 by Pelletier from two species of *Cinchona*, namely *Cinchona pubescens* Vahl (first described as *Quinquina succirubra* (Pav. ex Klotzsch) Kuntze) and *Cinchona calisaya* Wedd. (Rubiaceae).
Since quinine is known not only for its pharmacological properties but also for its taste, it will be described in more detail later in this chapter.

The other strategy used in drug discovery is a *target-based* strategy, also known as reverse pharmacology.
It avoids the screening step and has led to multiple successful discoveries, such as the Nobel Prize in 1988 [@doi:10.1126/science.2569237, @doi:10.1007/BF01119794].
The difficulties inherent in high-throughput screening of NPs can therefore be avoided, which has led pharmaceutical companies to focus on libraries of synthetic compounds [@doi:10.1126/science.1168243].
Nevertheless, as they acquired specific ligand-protein binding motifs, NPs cover a chemical space that cannot be met by synthetic compounds in commercially available screening libraries, making them great candidates for target-based discovery [@doi:10.1016/j.cbpa.2018.12.007].
Among the functional advantages in regard to synthetic compounds, NPs contain more aliphatic rings per molecule, more bridgehead atoms and chiral centers [@doi:10/b849kr].

Among the 16 new drugs approved by the FDA in 2022, only one is a NP [@url:https://www.fda.gov/drugs/new-drugs-fda-cders-new-molecular-entities-and-new-therapeutic-biological-products/novel-drug-approvals-2022].
Tapinarof, indicated in the treatment of psoriasis, was already found as an antibiotic in 1988 in Xenorhabdus luminescens Thomas & Poinar (now Photorhabdus luminescens) [@doi:10.1128/aem.54.6.1602-1605.1988].

In Switzerland, 30 new drugs were approved in 2022 for human use, none being a NP [@url:https://www.swissmedic.ch/swissmedic/en/home/humanarzneimittel/authorisations/new-medicines.html].
In parallel, Swissmedic authorized 8 new complementary medicinal products in 2021, mainly homeopathic [@url:https://www.swissmedic.ch/swissmedic/en/home/kpa/aktuell-kpa/neuzulassungen-kpa.html].
Swissmedic authorized 5 herbal medicinal products in 2021, one of them being loose nettle leaves.

In fact, despite all the advantages of NPs, the NP-based parts of drug discovery are in decline, mainly because of the analytical challenges they pose, which will be detailed in the next sub-chapter.
To overcome these limitations, phytochemistry has essentially turned to other areas, detailed below.
