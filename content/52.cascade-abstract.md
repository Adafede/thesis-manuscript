## Abstract {.unnumbered}

Recent developments in mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling allow unprecedented qualitative coverage of plant extract composition.
However, the electrospray ionization used in metabolite profiling generates multiple artifactual signals for a single analyte.
This leads to thousands of signals per analysis, without satisfactory means of filtering those corresponding to abundant constituents of the extract.
Generic approaches allowing to annotate both qualitatively and quantitatively a broad range of relevant constituents are therefore needed.
For this, an analytical platform that combines Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) with Charged Aerosol Detection (CAD) is used.
A generic metabolite profiling for the concomitant recording of qualitative MS data and semi-quantitative CAD profiles is established. 

The deconvoluted MS features (recorded in HRMS/MS DDA) are grouped and annotated using state-of-the-art tools.
After signal pretreatment and peak-shape comparison, those features are attributed to their corresponding extracted and integrated CAD peak.
Signals not attributed to CAD peaks corresponded to minor metabolites, annotated the same way.
This strategy allows to automatically contextualize features at both major and minor metabolome levels, together with a detailed reporting of their annotation including relevant orthogonal information (taxonomy, retention time).
Results are illustrated on an ethanolic extract of *Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H. Karst., a bitter plant of industrial interest.
This generic qualitative and quantitative approach paves the way to automatically assess the composition on single natural extracts of interest or broader collections, thus facilitating new ingredients registration or natural extract-based drug discovery campaigns.
