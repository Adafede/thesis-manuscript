# General Introduction {.page_break_before}

Humans, like other animals with the ability to move, have quickly learned to seek out the best variety of elements in their environment to ensure their survival and development.
This differentiates them from plants and other sessile organisms (organisms without self-locomotion), which are limited to the few elements that surround them.
Sessile organisms are therefore forced to transform these elements into more advantageous ones to ensure their survival.
After taking advantage of plants and their chemical machinery in an empirical way, humans decided to use and study them more in-depth.

Knowledge was first gained from whole plants, herbal mixtures, or herbal extracts, as described in many archaeological remains, such as the Ebers papyrus.
Herbal mixtures are still successfully used in traditional medicine as a primary source of care in many parts of the world, or as a supplement in others [@isbn:9789241506090].

In 1804, Friedrich Sert√ºmer, a German pharmacist, was the first human to isolate an active molecule from a plant.
He isolated morphine, an alkaloid, from *Papaver somniferum* L.
This was the beginning of modern phytochemistry.
