## Taste and [CAD](#cad)-informed Molecular Network  {#sapid-mn}

### Original Versus Enriched Molecular Network

![**Original versus enriched molecular network.** The main cluster of the [MN](#mn) is shown. In panel A, nodes correspond to features (1,087) found in the enriched extract. In panel B, nodes correspond to features (1,746) found in all the fractions.](images/sapid-mn-1.pdf "sapid-mn-1"){#fig:sapid-mn-1 short-caption="Original Versus Enriched Molecular Network" align="center" width="90%"}

### Chemically Annotated Molecular Network

![**Chemically annotated molecular network.** The main cluster of the [MN](#mn) is shown. Nodes are colored according to their chemical superclass. In panel B, the additional nodes in comparison to panel A mainly share the same superclass as their neighbors.](images/sapid-mn-2.pdf "sapid-mn-2"){#fig:sapid-mn-2 short-caption="Chemically Annotated Molecular Network" align="center" width="95%"}

### Taste Annotated Molecular Network

![**Taste annotated molecular network.** The main cluster of the [MN](#mn) is shown. Nodes are colored according to their taste. In panel A, the size of the nodes is represents the bitterness score based on the taste intensity reported, weighted by the [MS](#ms) intensity. The same is applied in panel B with [CAD](#cad) intensity. Less nodes are of large size.](images/sapid-mn-3.pdf "sapid-mn-3"){#fig:sapid-mn-3 short-caption="Chemically Annotated Molecular Network" align="center" width="95%"}
