## Determination of the Working Concentration  {#sapid-initial}

![**Determination of the working concentration.** Panel A represents the intensity score given to the sample in a triangle test \footnotemark{} as a function of the enriched extract concentration (only if the answer was correct). Panel B, reresents the number of correct answers in a triangle test as a function of sample concentration. Finally, panel C represents the occurrence of the descriptors attributed to the sample, multiplied by the intensity given to the sample, as a function of concentration.](images/sapid-initial.pdf "sapid-initial"){#fig:sapid-initial short-caption="Determination of the Working Concentration" align="center" width="93%"}
