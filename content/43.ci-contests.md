### [Lockdown Mass Spec Challenge](https://cenapt.pharm.uic.edu/2020/08/18/The-Lockdown-Mass-Spec-Challenge-Results/) (2021)

The UIC Botanical Center and the CENAPT Center organized The Lockdown Mass Spec Challenge in 2021.
The challenge followed the model used in the previous rounds of the CASMI contests. 
Participants were provided a set of 16 [MS](#ms) and [MS/MS](#msms) spectra and asked participants to deduce the structure of compounds based on the provided data.
The compounds were derived from plants and included both known and unknown compounds.
The unknown compounds were either unreported natural products or semi-synthetic analogs of known natural products.
For the first time, metadata included origins of the compounds.
Chromatographic data were also provided.
Participants could use any approach to arrive at the structures.

The detailed results are avaiilable in Appendix @sec:appendix-ci-lockdown.

### [Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification](https://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/casmi/casmi-2022-results) (2022)

For several challenges the class could not be determined by ClassyFire, therefore a key could not be found. These challenges were removed and only challenges with a key were kept.

Describe Sirius + TIMA + global foodomics


<!-- The challenge of annotating small molecules in liquid-chromatography coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS) is a major bottleneck to unlock insights into biological information in metabolomics.
This is due to the limited availability of fragmentation spectra in spectral libraries compared to the known metabolome space, but also to the lack of robust computational methods to automatically convert the spectra into chemical information.
Progress and limitations in computational annotation methods for annotating LC-HRMS are periodically benchmarked during the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification (CASMI) contests (http://casmi-contest.org/).
Since its introduction ten years ago, this contest has highlighted the emergence of computational methods for each task, including identification of the ion form (adducts, isotopologues, multimers), molecular formula, as well as putative structural annotation.
Back in 2022, the latest CASMI competition put on the spot for the first time the chemical class annotation capability, a task that aims at predicting a partial (but useful) chemical information.
For the CASMI 2022, we designed and tested a novel computational pipeline integrating SIRIUS/GNPS/TIMA-MASST. Preliminary results showed that for 246 challenges, our strategy top-performed by proposing the correct answer at the first rank for 93% ion forms, 94% molecular formula, 26% structure, and 69% chemical class.
Interestingly, it is the first time that computational methods performed better than manual expert annotation at all tasks, even if accurate structure annotation remains highly challenging without orthogonal information.
In this communication, we will discuss the competition and our annotation pipeline in detail.
