<!-- The challenge of annotating small molecules in liquid-chromatography coupled to a high resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS) is a major bottleneck to unlock insights into biological information in metabolomics.
This is due to the limited availability of fragmentation spectra in spectral libraries compared to the known metabolome space, but also to the lack of robust computational methods to automatically convert the spectral signals observed into chemical informations.
Progress and limitations in computational annotation methods for annotating LC-HRMS are periodically benchmarked during the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification (CASMI) contests (http://casmi-contest.org/).
Since its introduction ten years ago, this contest consecrated the emergence of computational methods for each task, including identification of the ion form (adducts, isotopologues, multimers), molecular formula, as well as putative structural annotation.
The CASMI2022 offered a revamped competition putting on the spot for the first time the chemical class annotation capability, a task that aims at predicting a partial (but useful) chemical information.
For the CASMI2022, we designed and tested a novel computational pipeline integrating SIRIUS/GNPS/TIMA-MASST.
Preliminary results showed that for 246 challenges, our strategy top-performed by proposing the correct answer at the first rank for 93% ion forms, 94% molecular formula, 26% structure, and 69% chemical class.
Thus, it is the first time that computational methods performed better than manual expert annotationcuration for all tasks, even if accurate structure annotation remains highly challenging without orthogonal information.
In this communication, we will present our annotation pipeline in detail.  -->
