Introduce Community contests

### [Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification](https://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/casmi/casmi-2022-results) (2022)

The Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification ([CASMI](#casmi)) Contest was founded in 2012 to provide scientists with a common open dataset to evaluate their [MS](#ms)-based annotation methods [@doi:10.3390/metabo3020412].

Manual Dejan [@doi:10.1016/j.phytol.2017.01.006]

<!-- Showcase your success in compound identification for up to 500 new unknowns, using raw LC-MS/MS data

In untargeted assays, approximately 80% of all MS/MS spectra remain unidentified. Yet, the last [CASMI](#casmi) contest was performed five years ago. As molecules of former [CASMI](#casmi) contests are now well known, new datasets must be provided for testing compound ID strategies in 2022. A new [CASMI](#casmi) comparative assessment of small molecule identifications is overdue. Hence, the UC Davis West Coast Metabolomics Center is spearheading such a workshop to take place for the Metabolomics Society 2022 Conference in Valencia, Spain.

To make this new [CASMI](#casmi) 2022 similar to an actual metabolomics study, we here provide raw LC-accurate mass MS/MS data in both +ESI and - ESI mode, with a list of 500 compounds and their retention times and accurate m/z values. Compounds are not included in public libraries but comprise both metabolites and exposome chemicals. If participants would be interested to participate but would struggle to extract mass spectra from these raw files, please contact us to receive the target MS/MS spectra as an .MSP files. If participants would like to receive .RAW instead of .mzml files for the full chromatograms, please contact us.

As these are many compounds, perhaps too many for some, feel free to only use a select number of targets. We will prioritize 250 of these 500 compounds, but certainly would be curious to see if automated processes could work on all of them or at least some of them?

Results will be discussed based on four different categories:

1. Correct annotation of adducts

2. Correct elemental formulas

3. Correct compound structure classes

4. Correct 2D chemical structures

Please, feel free and invited to test your skills, your workflows, your software, or your databases on any or all of these tasks!

Anyone can utilize this data and submit results. Submitters will be notified, and we will then select six submitters to showcase their results and approaches at the Metabolomics Society meeting (if necessary, even remotely or via recorded contributions - but preferred 'in person', of course!). All submitters will be invited to participate in manuscript writing afterward about this [CASMI](#casmi) 2022 exercise.

Additional Information:

    Who is the intended audience for this workshop: Anyone, but mainly advanced users in metabolomics with 2+ years of experience.
    Objectives for your workshop:
        Enable comparison of the current performance in compound ID approaches from raw data â€“ generate new public datasets and write a manuscript
        Understand the advantages and pitfalls of different compound identification approaches
        Advance expertise across disciplines toward compound identification
    Learning Outcomes for participants:
        Learn about current tools, software, and compound identification approaches.
        Ask panel experts how to use tools, including pitfalls or barriers to applying tools for your own research.
        Understand the different levels and hierarchies in compound identification, from determining adducts to elemental formulas, and structure classes to structure isomers.


For several challenges the class could not be determined by ClassyFire, therefore a key could not be found. These challenges were removed and only challenges with a key were kept.

Describe Sirius + TIMA + global foodomics


<!-- The challenge of annotating small molecules in liquid-chromatography coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS) is a major bottleneck to unlock insights into biological information in metabolomics.
This is due to the limited availability of fragmentation spectra in spectral libraries compared to the known metabolome space, but also to the lack of robust computational methods to automatically convert the spectra into chemical information.
Progress and limitations in computational annotation methods for annotating LC-HRMS are periodically benchmarked during the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification ([CASMI](#casmi)) contests (http://casmi-contest.org/).
Since its introduction ten years ago, this contest has highlighted the emergence of computational methods for each task, including identification of the ion form (adducts, isotopologues, multimers), molecular formula, as well as putative structural annotation.
Back in 2022, the latest [CASMI](#casmi) competition put on the spot for the first time the chemical class annotation capability, a task that aims at predicting a partial (but useful) chemical information.
For the [CASMI](#casmi) 2022, we designed and tested a novel computational pipeline integrating SIRIUS/GNPS/TIMA-MASST. Preliminary results showed that for 246 challenges, our strategy top-performed by proposing the correct answer at the first rank for 93% ion forms, 94% molecular formula, 26% structure, and 69% chemical class.
Interestingly, it is the first time that computational methods performed better than manual expert annotation at all tasks, even if accurate structure annotation remains highly challenging without orthogonal information.
In this communication, we will discuss the competition and our annotation pipeline in detail.

### [Lockdown Mass Spec Challenge](https://cenapt.pharm.uic.edu/2020/08/18/The-Lockdown-Mass-Spec-Challenge-Results/) (2021)

The UIC Botanical Center and the CENAPT Center organized *The Lockdown Mass Spec Challenge* in 2021.
The challenge followed the model used in the previous rounds of the [CASMI](#casmi) contests. 
Participants were provided a set of 16 [MS](#ms) and [MS/MS](#msms) spectra and asked participants to deduce the structure of compounds based on the provided data.
The compounds were derived from plants and included both known and unknown compounds.
The unknown compounds were either unreported natural products or semi-synthetic analogs of known natural products.
For the first time, metadata included origins of the compounds.
Chromatographic data were also provided.
Participants could use any approach to arrive at the structures.

Despite the relatively small number of challenges, a semi-automatic approach was used.
The results from Sirius, MSFinder and ISDB were combined and taxonomically weighted.
Candidates were then re-ordered according to their mean of their rank for each annotation tool used.
This approach obtained the best results of the contest.
The detailed results are available in Appendix @sec:appendix-ci-lockdown.
