### Results and Discussion {.page_break_before}

The first necessary step was to fractionate the previously obtained enriched pre-fraction.
This was done according to the procedure described in @sec:mmmplc and led to 82 fractions.
The recovery was 78% of the initial weight (Table available in Appendix @sec:sapid-appendix-masses).
53 out of those 82 fractions were selected for the rest of the study (fractions 17 to 71, the previous ones were empty because of the [VLC](#vlc) procedure, fraction 49 was empty and fractions above 71 were too apolar).
The chromatogram of the enriched pre-fraction compared to the chromatograms of the selected fractions is illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-1.

The groups illustrated on Figure @fig:sapid-1 were made based on hierarchical clustering of the ^1^H [NMR](#nmr) analysis of the fractions.
These groups were necessary for the tasting.
Indeed, in order to obtain a more detailed view of the taste of the extract, each fraction was tested individually.
To avoid saturation, the panelists could not taste more than 7 fractions per session.
To highlight the finest possible differences, the tasting sessions were organized so as to taste similar fractions during the same session, as illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-2.
The similarity of the fractions was therefore evaluated on [NMR](#nmr) signals, as it offers a generic quantitative chemical view on the majority components.

![**General workflow leading to *chemically informed tasting***. First, the extract is fractionated by chromatographic methods as in panel A. Second, generic quantitative chemical information is obtained through [NMR](#nmr) (panel B). Finally, fractions are tested by groups, based on their chemistry (panel C).](images/sapid-2.pdf "sapid-2"){#fig:sapid-2 short-caption="General Workflow Leading to *Chemically Informed Tasting*" align="center" width="100%"}

The *chemically informed tasting* illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-2 was performed as follows.
First, participants were given blindly a glass of Chasselas (white wine, not aromatic).
They had to score its intensity according to nine descriptors they were trained on.
This had the double advantage of mouth preparation and having a standard for each experiment (a summary of the variation in the scores is available in Appendix @sec:sapid-variation).
Then, a group of fractions was evaluated using the napping method.
The napping method consisted in placing glasses on a square, grouping the similar ones together.
This had the advantage of capturing information that might not otherwise be described.
If the panelists could associate a word with the position, they did so and generated a free profile of the fraction.
The self-generated vocabulary was then submitted to the panelists in order to score the intensity of each fraction for each descriptor.
An example of the whole process and associated statistical treatment is available in Appendix @sec:sapid-stats.
Finally, a second glass of Chasselas was given at the end of the experiment, to assess possible taste modulating activity of the fractions.
The summary of the taste modulating activities of each group of fractions is available in Appendix @sec:sapid-violins. 
In total, among all experiments, 61 descriptors were generated and categorized into 12 categories.
These descriptors, with their english-translated category are illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-3.
Two categories were related to aroma and not to taste and are not illustrated.

The color of the edges represents the category the descriptor was attributed to. The size of the font and edges represents the number of occurrences.](images/sapid-3.pdf "sapid-3"){#fig:sapid-3 short-caption="Network of the Generated Descriptors" align="center" width="100%"}
