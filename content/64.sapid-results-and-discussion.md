### Results and Discussion {.page_break_before}

The first necessary step to deconvolute the taste of *S chirayita* in the finest details was to fractionate the enriched extract at large scale.
The obtained fractions had to fulfill all criteria to be then used for tasting by the panelists.
The fractionation was done according to the procedure described in @sec:mmmplc and led to 82 fractions.
The recovery was 78% of the initial mass (10g, table available in Appendix @sec:sapid-appendix-masses).
53 out of those 82 fractions were selected for the rest of the study (fractions 17 to 71, the previous ones were empty because of the [VLC](#vlc) enrichment procedure used, fraction 49 was empty and fractions above 71 were too apolar).
The chromatogram of the enriched extract compared to the chromatograms of the selected fractions is illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-1.

Except for the peaks at the end of the chromatogram (those fractions were discarded as being too apolar), good correlation can be observed between the enriched extract in panel A and the fractions obtained in panel B.
The fractionation grouping illustrated on Figure @fig:sapid-1 were made based on hierarchical clustering of the ^1^H [NMR](#nmr) analysis of the fractions, acquired concomitantly.
Such grouping was necessary for the tasting.
Indeed, in order to obtain a more detailed view of the taste of the extract, each fraction was tested individually.
To avoid saturation, the panelists could not taste more than 7 fractions per session.
To highlight the finest possible differences, the tasting sessions were organized so as to taste similar fractions during the same session, as illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-2.
The similarity of the fractions was therefore evaluated on [NMR](#nmr) signals, as it offers a generic quantitative chemical view on the major compounds.

![**General workflow leading to *chemically informed tasting***. First, the extract is fractionated by chromatographic methods as in panel A. Second, generic quantitative chemical information is obtained through [NMR](#nmr) (panel B). Finally, fractions are tested by groups, based on their chemistry (panel C).](images/sapid-2.pdf "sapid-2"){#fig:sapid-2 short-caption="General Workflow Leading to *Chemically Informed Tasting*" align="center" width="100%"}

After fractionation, all fractions were analyzed by means of [HR](#hr)[MS/MS](#msms) and [NMR](#nmr) (Figure @fig:sapid-2, panel A and B).
This allowed *chemically informed tasting* (Figure @fig:sapid-2, panel C) to be performed as follows:
First, panelists were given blindly a glass of Chasselas (white wine, not aromatic).
They had to score its intensity according to nine descriptors they were trained on.
This had the double advantage of mouth preparation and having a standard for each experiment (a summary of the variation in the scores is available in Appendix @sec:sapid-variation).
Then, a group of fractions was evaluated using the "napping" method.
The "napping" method consisted in placing glasses on a square, grouping the similar ones together.
This had the advantage of capturing information that might not otherwise be described.
If the panelists could associate a word with the position, they did so and generated a free profile of the fraction.
The self-generated vocabulary was then submitted to the panelists in order to score the intensity of each fraction for each descriptor.
This generated a plot, where samples had x,y coordinates and eventually descriptors associated to these positions, compatible with further multivariate data analysis.
An example of the whole process and associated statistical treatment is available in Appendix @sec:sapid-stats.
Finally, a second glass of Chasselas was given at the end of the experiment, to assess possible taste modulating activity of the fractions.
The summary of the taste modulating activities of each group of fractions is available in Appendix @sec:sapid-violins. 
In total, among all experiments, 61 descriptors were generated and categorized into 12 categories.
These descriptors, with their english-translated category are illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-3.
Two categories were related to aroma and not to taste and are not illustrated.

![**Network of the generated descriptors.** If two descriptors were used for the same sample, they are linked together. The color of the edges represents the category the descriptor was attributed to. The size of the font and edges represents the number of occurrences.](images/sapid-3.pdf "sapid-3"){#fig:sapid-3 short-caption="Network of the Generated Descriptors" align="center" width="100%"}

The categories illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-3 were used to regroup the different descriptors generated for each group of fractions to gain statistical power.
The result of such grouping on the missing values for the bitter taste is available in Appendix @sec:sapid-matrix.
With those harmonized categories, the intensities reported by each panelist could be summed, to obtain a global view of the taste of each sample.
The result of such view on the total enriched extract, in relation to its [MS](#ms)-based *comprehensive compositional assessment* is illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-5.

![**Chemical and sensory analyses of the total enriched extract.** In panel A, the major classes of compounds according to the *comprehensive compositional assessment* are represented. Peaks without confident annotation are represented in grey. In panel B, the main tastes obtained after the *chemically informed tasting* are presented.](images/sapid-5.pdf "sapid-5"){#fig:sapid-5 short-caption="Chemical and Sensory Analyses of the Total extract" align="center" width="100%"}

The view presented in Figure @fig:sapid-5 allowed to rapidly identify major classes of compounds and taste.
In comparison to the analysis of *S. chirayita* presented in Figure @fig:cascade-7, this time, all the peaks were kept, even without confident annotation.
This could eventually allow to link them to taste later on, even if they were not or partially annotated at the structural level.

To get a more accurate view, the same process was used at the fraction level, as illustrated in Figure @fig:sapid-6.
