## Conclusion {.page_break_before}

The recent developments in mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling generate huge amounts of high-quality data.
Processing and making sense of this data can be highly challenging.
The workflow here presented aims to compensate issues related to electrospray ionization by hyphenating so called "universal" detectors such as [ELSD](#elsd) or [CAD](#cad) to [LC](#lc)-[MS](#ms) profiling platforms.
This should help deciphering the data to make informed decisions. 

While our efforts were focused on the automation of the confidence in the annotation and peak-shape similarity calculation, some improvements in the quantitation could be envisioned.

A first possible improvement towards more accurate quantitation could come from the implementation of an inverse elution gradient.
Indeed, the proportion of organic solvent has a considerable effect on the response [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2013.07.111; @doi:10.1002/9781119390725.ch4].
This could also be corrected by using algorithmics, such as suggested by [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.09.056; @doi:10.1021/ac060078j].

However, the proportion of organic solvent is not the only parameter to take into account for improving the precision of the quantitation [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2011.01.062].
Even if often considered as universal, non-neglectable differences have been observed depending of the chemical structures studied [@doi:10.1186/s13321-021-00532-0].
In addition, [CAD](#cad) response is non-linear and uses a power function that has to be taken into account [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2020.461844; @doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2019.04.017].
Another limitation is the chromatographic resolution needed.
Indeed, high peak capacities are required to achieve good results.

With those limitations taken into account, we believe our workflow will be particularly useful to mine meaningful compositional data.
This should facilitate for the registration of botanical ingredients and help the efficient isolation of new NPs.
