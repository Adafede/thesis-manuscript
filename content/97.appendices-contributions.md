### [Combining Activity Profiling with Advanced Annotation to Accelerate the Discovery of Natural Products Targeting Oncogenic Signaling in Melanoma](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c00146)

#### Abstract
The discovery of bioactive natural products remains a time-consuming and challenging task.
The ability to link high-confidence metabolite annotations in crude extracts with activity would be highly beneficial to the drug discovery process.
To address this challenge, HPLC-based activity profiling and advanced UHPLC-HRMS/MS metabolite profiling for annotation were combined to leverage the information obtained from both approaches on a crude extract scaled down to the submilligram level.
This strategy was applied to a subset of an extract library screening aiming to identify natural products inhibiting oncogenic signaling in melanoma.
Advanced annotation and data organization enabled the identification of compounds that were likely responsible for the activity in the extracts.
These compounds belonged to two different natural product scaffolds, namely, brevipolides from a Hyptis brevipes extract and methoxylated flavonoids identified in three different extracts of Hyptis and Artemisia spp.
Targeted isolation of these prioritized compounds led to five brevipolides and seven methoxylated flavonoids.
Brevipolide A (**1**) and 6-methoxytricin (**9**) were the most potent compounds from each chemical class and displayed AKT activity inhibition with an IC~50~ of 17.6 ± 1.6 and 4.9 ± 0.2 *μ*M, respectively.

### [Targeted isolation of photoactive pigments from mushrooms yielded a highly potent new photosensitizer: 7,7′-biphyscion](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-04975-9) {.page_break_before}

#### Abstract
Pigments of fungi are a fertile ground of inspiration: they spread across various chemical backbones, absorption ranges, and bioactivities.
However, basidiomycetes with strikingly colored fruiting bodies have never been explored as agents for photodynamic therapy (PDT), even though known photoactive compound classes (e.g., anthraquinones or alkaloids) are used as chemotaxonomic markers.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the dyes of skin-heads (dermocyboid Cortinarii) can produce singlet oxygen under irradiation and thus are natural photosensitizers.
Three photosensitizers based on anthraquinone structures were isolated and photopharmaceutical tests were conducted.
For one of the three, i.e., (–)-7,7′-biphyscion (**1**), a promising photoyield and photocytotoxicity of EC~50~ = 0.064 *µ*M against cancer cells (A549) was found under blue light irradiation (λ~exc~ = 468 nm, 9.3 J/cm^2).
The results of molecular biological methods, e.g., a viability assay and a cell cycle analysis, demonstrated the harmlessness of 1 in the dark and highlighted the apoptosis-inducing PDT potential under blue light irradiation.
These results demonstrate for the first time that pigments of dermocyboid Cortinarii possess a so far undescribed activity, i.e., photoactivity, with significant potential for the field of PDT.
The dimeric anthraquinone (–)-7,7′-biphyscion (**1**) was identified as a promising natural photosensitizer.

### [Feature-Based Molecular Networking—An Exciting Tool to Spot Species of the Genus <i>Cortinarius</i> with Hidden Photosensitizers](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo11110791) {.page_break_before}

#### Abstract
Fungi have developed a wide array of defense strategies to overcome mechanical injuries and pathogen infections.
Recently, photoactivity has been discovered by showing that pigments isolated from *Cortinarius uliginosus* produce singlet oxygen under irradiation.
To test if this phenomenon is limited to dermocyboid Cortinarii, six colourful *Cortinarius* species belonging to different classical subgenera (i.e., *Dermocybe*, *Leprocybe*, *Myxacium*, *Phlegmacium*, and *Telamonia*) were investigated.
Fungal extracts were explored by the combination of in vitro photobiological methods, UHPLC coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS^2^), feature-based molecular networking ([FBMN](#fbmn)), and metabolite dereplication techniques.
The fungi *C. rubrophyllus* (*Dermocybe*) and *C. xanthophyllus* (*Phlegmacium*) exhibited promising photobiological activity in a low concentration range (1–7 *µ*g/mL).
Using UHPLC-HRMS^2^-based metabolomic tools, the underlying photoactive principle was investigated.
Several monomeric and dimeric anthraquinones were annotated as compounds responsible for the photoactivity.
Furthermore, the results showed that light-induced activity is not restricted to a single subgenus, but rather is a trait of *Cortinarius* species of different phylogenetic lineages and is linked to the presence of fungal anthraquinones.
This study highlights the genus *Cortinarius* as a promising source for novel photopharmaceuticals.
Additionally, we showed that putative dereplication of natural photosensitizers can be done by ([FBMN](#fbmn)).

### [Drug Repurposing to Identify a Synergistic High-Order Drug Combination to Treat Sunitinib-Resistant Renal Cell Carcinoma](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13163978) {.page_break_before}

#### Abstract
Repurposed drugs have been evaluated for the management of clear cell renal cell carcinoma ([ccRCC](#ccrcc)), but only a few have influenced the overall survival of patients with advanced disease.
To combine repurposed non-oncology with oncological drugs, we applied our validated phenotypic method, which consisted of a reduced experimental part and data modeling.
A synergistic optimized multidrug combination (ODC) was identified to significantly reduce the energy levels in cancer remaining inactive in non-cancerous cells.
The ODC consisted of Rapta-C, erlotinib, metformin and parthenolide and low doses.
Molecular and functional analysis of ODC revealed a loss of adhesiveness and induction of apoptosis.
Gene-expression network analysis displayed significant alterations in the cellular metabolism, confirmed by LC-MS based metabolomic analysis, highlighting significant changes in the lipid classes.
We used heterotypic in vitro 3D co-cultures and ex vivo organoids to validate the activity of the ODC, maintaining an efficacy of over 70%.
Our results show that repurposed drugs can be combined to target cancer cells selectively with prominent activity.
The strong impact on cell adherence and metabolism indicates a favorable mechanism of action of the ODC to treat [ccRCC](#ccrcc).

### [Molecular and Functional Analysis of Sunitinib-Resistance Induction in Human Renal Cell Carcinoma Cells](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22126467) {.page_break_before}

#### Abstract
Resistance in clear cell renal cell carcinoma ([ccRCC](#ccrcc)) against sunitinib is a multifaceted process encompassing numerous molecular aberrations.
This induces clinical complications, reducing the treatment success.
Understanding these aberrations helps us to select an adapted treatment strategy that surpasses resistance mechanisms, reverting the treatment insensitivity.
In this regard, we investigated the dominant mechanisms of resistance to sunitinib and validated an optimized multidrug combination to overcome this resistance.
Human [ccRCC](#ccrcc) cells were exposed to single or chronic treatment with sunitinib to obtain three resistant clones.
Upon manifestation of sunitinib resistance, morphometric changes in the cells were observed.
At the molecular level, the production of cell membrane and extracellular matrix components, chemotaxis, and cell cycle progression were dysregulated.
Molecules enforcing the cell cycle progression, i.e., cyclin A, B1, and E, were upregulated.
Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the intra- and extracellular presence of *N*-desethyl sunitinib, the active metabolite.
Lysosomal sequestration of sunitinib was confirmed.
After treatment with a synergistic optimized drug combination, the cell metabolic activity in Caki-1-sunitinib-resistant cells and 3D heterotypic co-cultures was reduced by >80%, remaining inactive in non-cancerous cells.
These results demonstrate geno- and phenotypic changes in response to sunitinib treatment upon resistance induction.
Mimicking resistance in the laboratory served as a platform to study drug responses.

### [Antiseizure potential of the ancient Greek medicinal plant *Helleborus odorus subsp. cyclophyllus* and identification of its main active principles](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.112954) {.page_break_before}

#### Abstract
**Ethnopharmacological relevance**

Ethnopharmacological data and ancient texts support the use of black hellebore (*Helleborus odorus subsp. cyclophyllus*, Ranunculaceae) for the management and treatment of epilepsy in ancient Greece.

**Aim of the study**

A pharmacological investigation of the root methanolic extract (RME) was conducted using the zebrafish epilepsy model to isolate and identify the compounds responsible for a potential antiseizure activity and to provide evidence of its historical use.
In addition, a comprehensive metabolite profiling of this studied species was proposed.

**Materials and methods**

The roots were extracted by solvents of increasing polarity and root decoction (RDE) was also prepared.
The extracts were evaluated for antiseizure activity using a larval zebrafish epilepsy model with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures.
The RME exhibited the highest antiseizure activity and was therefore selected for bioactivity-guided fractionation.
Isolated compounds were fully characterized by NMR and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS).
The UHPLC-HRMS/MS analyses of the RME and RDE were used for dereplication and metabolite profiling.

**Results**

The RME showed 80% inhibition of PTZ-induced locomotor activity (300 *μ*g/ml).
This extract was fractionated and resulted in the isolation of a new glucopyranosyl-deoxyribonolactone (**1**) and a new furostanol saponin derivative (**2**), as well as of 20-hydroxyecdysone (**3**), hellebrin (**4**), a spirostanol glycoside derivative (**5**) and deglucohellebrin (**6**).
The antiseizure activity of RME was found to be mainly due to the new furostanol saponin (**2**) and hellebrin (**4**), which reduced 45% and 60% of PTZ-induced seizures (135 *μ*M, respectively).
Besides, the aglycone of hellebrin, hellebrigenin (**S34**), was also active (45% at 7 *μ*M).
To further characterize the chemical composition of both RME and RDE, 30 compounds (**A7-33**, **A35–37**) were annotated based on UHPLC-HRMS/MS metabolite profiling.
This revealed the presence of additional bufadienolides, furostanols, and evidenced alkaloids.

**Conclusions**

This study is the first to identify the molecular basis of the ethnopharmacological use of black hellebore for the treatment of epilepsy.
This was achieved using a microscale zebrafish epilepsy model to rapidly quantify in vivo antiseizure activity.
The UHPLC-HRMS/MS profiling revealed the chemical diversity of the extracts and the presence of numerous bufadienolides, furostanols and ecdysteroids, also present in the decoction.

### [Insights on the Structural and Metabolic Resistance of Potato (*Solanum tuberosum*) Cultivars to Tuber Black Dot (*Colletotrichum coccodes*)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.01287) {.page_break_before}

#### Abstract
Black dot is a blemish disease of potato tubers caused by the phytopathogenic fungus *Colletotrichum coccodes*.
Qualitative resistance (monogenic) that leads to the hypersensitive response has not been reported against black dot, but commercial potato cultivars show different susceptibility levels to the disease, indicating that quantitative resistance (polygenic) mechanisms against this pathogen exist.
Cytological studies are essential to decipher pathogen colonization of the plant tissue, and untargeted metabolomics has been shown effective in highlighting resistance-related metabolites in quantitative resistance.
In this study, we used five commercial potato cultivars with different susceptibility levels to black dot, and studied the structural and biochemical aspects that correlate with resistance to black dot using cytological and untargeted metabolomics methods.
The cytological approach using semithin sections of potato tuber periderm revealed that *C. coccodes* colonizes the tuber periderm, but does not penetrate in cortical cells.
Furthermore, skin thickness did not correlate with disease susceptibility, indicating that other factors influence quantitative resistance to black dot.
Furthermore, suberin amounts did not correlate with black dot severity, and suberin composition was similar between the five potato cultivars studied.
On the other hand, the untargeted metabolomics approach allowed highlighting biomarkers of infection, as well as constitutive and induced resistance-related metabolites.
Hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxycinnamic acid amides and steroidal saponins were found to be biomarkers of resistance under control conditions, while hydroxycoumarins were found to be specifically induced in the resistant cultivars.
Notably, some of these biomarkers showed antifungal activity in vitro against *C. coccodes*.
Altogether, our results show that quantitative resistance of potatoes to black dot involves structural and biochemical mechanisms, including the production of specialized metabolites with antifungal properties.

### [Phytochemical analysis of the methanolic leaves extract of *Niedenzuella multiglandulosa* (Malpighiaceae), a plant species toxic to cattle in Brazil](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2020.02.005) {.page_break_before}

#### Abstract
*Niedenzuella multiglandulosa* (Malpighiaceae) is a neotropical liana responsible for cattle intoxication outbreaks in Brazil that may lead to abortion and even death of the animals, causing substantial losses in Brazilian trade balance.
A phytochemical study of *N. multiglandulosa* leaves was performed in order to obtain chemical information about secondary metabolites of this poorly studied species.
The methanolic extract was purified by medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) combined with semi preparative HPLC-PDA leading to the isolation of 16 compounds, including a new steroid named 5-hydroxypodecdysone B (**13**).
The structure of the isolated compounds was determined by classical spectroscopic methods such as NMR and HRMS.
Complementary ^19^F NMR and UPLC-HRMS analysis did not detect the presence of monofluoracetate (MFA), a toxic compound previously described from this species.

### [Identification of Antifungal Compounds from the Root Bark of *Cordia anisophylla* J.S. Mill.](https://doi.org/10.21577/0103-5053.20180221) {.page_break_before}

#### Abstract
The dichloromethane extract of the root bark of the Panamanian plant *Cordia anisophylla* J.S. Mill. (Boraginaceae) presented antifungal activity against a susceptible strain of *Candida albicans* in a bioautography primary screening.
The susceptible strain was used to detect minor active compounds that would not have been detected using a classical approach.
In order to identify the antimicrobial compounds, the active extract was fractionated by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography and the fractions were submitted to the antifungal bioassay.
This procedure enabled a precise localization of the antifungal compounds directly in the chromatogram of the crude extract and allowed for an efficient, targeted isolation.
Four compounds were isolated, one of which is a new natural product.
The structures were elucidated using spectroscopic methods.
Their antifungal properties were evaluated by determination of the minimum inhibitory quantity and concentration by bioautography and dilution assay against a wild type strain of *C. albicans*.
