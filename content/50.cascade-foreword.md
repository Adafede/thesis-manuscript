## Foreword {.unnumbered}

As important challenges posed by annotation have been adressed in the previous chapters, this chapter focuses on the attribution of universal semi-quantitative attributes to the broadest possible range of compounds.
To this extent, a Charged Aerosol Detector (CAD) has been coupled to our Orbitrap platform.
This setting, consisting of an Acquity UHPLC, a Q-Exactive Focus Orbitrap, and a CAD was the first in Europe.
While the technical coupling of both detectors is trivial, automatic solutions to link both signals are needed.

In the coming chapter, methodological developments to link MS features to CAD peaks are presented, thus compounding the quantitation issues related to electrospray ionization.
Taking advantage of the previously developed tools coupled with other open state-of-the-art solutions, MS features are not only contextualized within a CAD context, but also informed on multiple levels.
This results in automated comprehensive compositional assessments, which can be used to guide isolation efforts, or help registering new ingredients.

The chapter is presented as an article, but was not published.
