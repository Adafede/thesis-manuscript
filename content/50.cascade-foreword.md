## Foreword {.unnumbered}

As the important annotation challenges have been addressed in previous chapters, this chapter focuses on assigning universal semi-quantitative attributes to the widest possible range of compounds.
To this end, a charged aerosol detector (CAD) has been coupled to our Orbitrap platform.
This installation, consisting of an Acquity UHPLC, an Orbitrap Q-Exactive Focus and a CAD, was the first in Europe.
While the technical coupling of the two detectors is almost trivial, automatic solutions to link the two signals are required.

The following chapter presents methodological developments to link MS features to CAD peaks, which compensates the quantification problems related to electrospray ionization.
Building on the previously developed tools, coupled with other state-of-the-art open solutions, MS features are not only contextualized in a CAD context, but also informed at multiple levels.
The result is an automated comprehensive compositional assessment that can be used to guide isolation efforts or help register new ingredients.

The chapter is presented as an article, but was not published.
