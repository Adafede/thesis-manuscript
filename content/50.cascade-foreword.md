## Foreword {.unnumbered}

As the important annotation challenges have been addressed in previous chapters, this chapter focuses on assigning universal semi-quantitative attributes to the widest possible range of compounds.
To this end, a charged aerosol detector (CAD) has been coupled to an Orbitrap platform used for the analyses of crude extracts, as described in XXX `\\TODO`.
This installation, consisting of an Acquity UHPLC, an Orbitrap Q-Exactive Focus and a CAD, was the first in Europe.
While the technical coupling of the two detectors is almost trivial, automatic solutions to link the two signals are required.

The following chapter presents methodological developments to link MS features to CAD peaks, with the aim to compensate the quantification problems related to electrospray ionization when used for generic semi-quantitative estimation of all detected compounds.
Building on the previously developed tools, coupled with other state-of-the-art open solutions, 

`\\TODO` Rephrase

MS features are not only contextualized in a CAD context, but also informed at multiple levels.


The result is an automated comprehensive compositional assessment workflow that can be used to guide isolation efforts by providing semi-quantitative data on peaks of interest,t, or help to rapidly provide qualitative and semi-quantitative metabolite profiles to aid, for example, in the registration of new natural ingredients.

The chapter is presented as an article, it has not yet been submitted for publication.
