## Foreword {.unnumbered}

As the important annotation challenges have been addressed in previous chapters, this chapter focuses on assigning universal semi-quantitative attributes to the widest possible range of compounds.
To this end, a charged aerosol detector (CAD) has been coupled to an Orbitrap platform used in previous chapters for the analyses of crude extracts.
This installation, consisting of an Acquity UHPLC, an Orbitrap Q-Exactive Focus and a CAD, was the first in Europe.
While the technical coupling of the two detectors is almost trivial, automatic solutions to link the two signals are required.

The following chapter presents methodological developments to link MS features to CAD peaks, with the aim to compensate for the quantification problems related to electrospray ionization when used for generic semi-quantitative estimation of all detected compounds.
Building on the previously developed tools, coupled with other state-of-the-art open solutions, 
MS features are informed in two ways.
First, they are informed within a chromatographic peak context.
Second, they are informed within a spectral network context.
Additionally, MS features can be informed by biological or chemical taxonomy.
Finally, the confidence of the annotation of each feature can be estimated.

The result is an automated comprehensive compositional assessment workflow that can be used to guide isolation efforts by providing semi-quantitative data on peaks of interest or help to rapidly provide qualitative and semi-quantitative metabolite profiles to aid, for example, in the registration of new natural ingredients.

The chapter is presented as an article, it has not yet been submitted for publication.
