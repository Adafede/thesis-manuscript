## Analytical Methods {#sec:anal}

After the previously mentioned methods, the next logical step is to detect what constitutes the  *extracted* metabolome (see Figure @fig:intro-metabolomes).

### The *Detected Metabolome*

This section discusses the different types of detectors that can be used in classical phytochemical research.
As preliminary note, none of these detectors alone can detect *all* [NP](#np)s [@doi:10.1055/s-0028-1088393; @doi:10.1002/jssc.200900152].

#### The *Colored Metabolome* ([UV](#uv)-visible & Photo Diode Array)

The historical detector in [NP](#np) chemistry is the ultraviolet([UV](#uv))-visible detector.
It can typically acquire in the 190-600nm range, thus covering partialy both the [UV](#uv) (10-400nm) and visible (380-750nm) domains.
Before such detector, compounds were often sprayed with specific reagents to become visible [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.12.068], as the detector was the human eye.

The first [UV](#uv)-visible detectors were able to acquire at a single wavelength only.
The result of a classical single [LC](#lc)-[UV](#uv) analysis was called a *chromatogram*.
Later on, multiple wavelengths could be acquired simultaneously, and Photo Diode Arrays ([PDA](#pda)s), allowing to obtain *spectra* \footnotemark{}.
\footnotetext{Both \textit{chromatogram} and \textit{spectrum} will be explained later.}

The [UV](#uv)-[PDA](#pda) detectors are almost universal at low wavelength, their signal is relatively immune to changes of mobile phases and has a linear dynamic range of approximately 5 orders of magnitudes with a high precision (<0.2% relative standard deviation), thus making it well suited for regulatory analysis [@url:https://www.chromatographyonline.com/view/ultraviolet-detectors-perspectives-principles-and-practices].
However, to be detected, analytes have to contain chromophores to be detected, and the signal intensity can vary greatly depending on these chromphores (high variability for different comopunds).
Finally, the structural information obtained from [UV](#uv) spectra is low.

#### The *Charged Metabolome* (Mass Spectrometry)

The principle of Mass Spectrometry ([MS](#ms)) is to separate ions according to their mass to charge ratio ([*m/z*](#mz)).
Therefore, the process that takes place in a [MS](#ms) detector can be divided in two parts:
First, the ionization process, where the ions are generated, and second, the separation of the ions in a high vacuum, driven by electric and magnetic fields.

Thus, to be detected, a compound must be ionized.
This can be done with the use of various ionization techniques, which are generally divided into *soft* and *hard*.
While hard ionization techniques, leading to high fragmentation, are mainly used in [GC](#gc) analyses, the most used techniques in [LC](#lc)-[MS](#ms) are atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and electrospray ([ESI](#esi)).
Both can be considered as complementary [@doi:10.1021/ac701982e], as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization is best suited for the analysis of compounds wiht low to intermediate polarity, whereas [ESI](#esi) aims at analyzing larger compounds with intermediate to high polarity [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.02.049].

Since [ESI](#esi) was almost exclusively used for this work, its main steps are detailed hereafter.
First, charged droplets are created at the end of the capillary coming from the [LC](#lc).
These droplets are either positively or negatively charged, depending on the polarity of the applied voltage.
The solvent constituing the droplets is gradually evaporated, leading to gas phase ions [@doi:10.1021/ac302789c].
The ions are then transfered to the mass analyzer by means of an electric field [@doi:10.1002/mas.10008].

As for ionization methods, multiple types of mass analyzers exist.
They are generally divided into *low* (quardupoles, ion traps) and *high* (Time of flight, Orbitrap [@doi:10.1002/jms.856; @doi:10.1021/ac991131p], Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance) resolving power.
The resolving power corresponds to the mass of an ion divided by the full width at half maximum ([FWHM](#fwhm)) of its corresponding peak.
A resolving power of less than 10,000 is considered *low* resolution and higher values as *high* resolution.
Low resolution analyzers are better suited for quantitative analysis, while high resolution analyzers, which can determine the mass with 0.001 mass unit precision, and thus exact mass, are better suited for qualitative, untargeted analysis.
A [UHPLC](#uhplc)-[ESI](#esi)-Orbitrap [@doi:10.1021/ac0258047] setup was used for this work mainly, with some more details exlpained below.

##### The *Fragmented Metabolome* (Tandem Mass Spectrometry)

As the analysis aimed at the structural annotation (qualification) of the highest possible number of compounds, fragmentation spectra were acquired.
Multiple ways exist to obtain fragmentation spectra.
While some exotic experiments were performed, the best compromise actually remains the alternance of full scans with Data Dependent Acquisition ([DDA](#dda)) [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04491].
In this mode, fragmentation spectra are obtained by the isolation of a precursor ion, which is then fragmented.
This precursor ion is usually the most abundant of the ions detected in full scan mode, and is placed for some time on a dynamic exclusion list for some time to fragment other, less intense, ions.
The fragmentation spectra contain more structural information than full scan spectra.
However, full scan spectra and their isotopic patterns, sometimes with some adducts or in-source fragments are of great help in retrieving the correct structural annotation.

While [MS](#ms) is the more versatile detector in terms of structural annotation, the ionization behaviour, particularily in [ESI](#esi), is heavily structure dependent (as previsouly for [UV](#uv)).
For this reason, coupling to another, more generic detector to assess quantities more accurately the amounts seems a good idea.

#### The *Semi-quantified Metabolome*

True quantification is time consuming, expensive, requires the use of (possibly deuterated) standards, which makes it unusable for untargeted analysis.
This is why detectors giving responses that are ideally independent of the analyte and the mobile phase are needed.
One of the oldlest detectors of that type is the Flame Ionization Detector ([FID](#fid)), even if some adjustements of the response factor are still needed [@doi:10.1002/ffj.3098].
While some experimental [LC](#lc)-[FID](#fid) exist [@doi:10.1016/j.talanta.2019.120229], the most used "generic" detectors in [LC](#lc) analyses are the Evaporative Light Scattering Detector ([ELSD](#elsd)) [@doi:10.1021/np300034c; @doi:10.3390/molecules24020323] and the Charged Aerosol Detector ([CAD](#cad)) [@doi:10.1007/s11419-017-0392-7; @doi:10.1016/j.jpba.2018.09.029].

##### Evaporative Light Scattering Detector

Similarly to [ESI](#esi), the mobile phase is first nebulized into droplets [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.080].
The droplets are then sprayed through a heated drift tube where the solvent and volatile substances are evaporated. 
Therefore, only compounds less volatiles than the solvent are likely to be detected.
The non-volatile compounds then pass a light beam and the scattering of light is measured.
The scattering is proportional to the amount of compounds present, but also to their size. Therefore, large compounds are overestimated, the same way as compounds eluting at high percentages of organic (volatile) sovlent if no make-up pump is used.
Some proposals were made to compensate for those limitations [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2007.05.101; @doi:10.1021/cc990068e].
Beside these limitations, [ELSD](#elsd) remains a detector of choice for compounds without chromophore, such as sugars and lipids, or poorly ionized.

##### Charged Aerosol Detector

[CAD](#cad) uses the same nebulizing principle as [ELSD](#elsd), but the detection is made through the measurement of corona-charged ions through an ion trap.
This makes it slightly more sensitive than [ELSD](#elsd) [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.080; @doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.04.047; @doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2011.01.062].
It has also be shown, in a limited range, to be more sensitive than [UV](#uv) [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.09.056].
