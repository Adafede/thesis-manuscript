## Analytical Methods {#sec:anal}

After the previously mentioned methods, the next logical step is to detect what constitutes the  *extracted* metabolome (see Figure @fig:intro-metabolomes).

### The *Detected Metabolome*

This section discusses the different types of detectors that can be used in classical phytochemical research.
As preliminary note, none of these detectors alone can detect *all* [NP](#np)s [@doi:10.1055/s-0028-1088393; @doi:10.1002/jssc.200900152].

#### The *Colored Metabolome* ([UV](#uv)-visible & Photo Diode Array)

The historical detector in [NP](#np) chemistry is the ultraviolet([UV](#uv))-visible detector.
It can typically acquire in the 190-600nm range, thus covering partialy both the [UV](#uv) (10-400nm) and visible (380-750nm) domains.
Before such detector, compounds were often sprayed with specific reagents to become visible [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.12.068], as the detector was the human eye.

The first [UV](#uv)-visible detectors were able to acquire at a single wavelength only.
The result of a classical single [LC](#lc)-[UV](#uv) analysis was called a *chromatogram*.
Later on, multiple wavelengths could be acquired simultaneously, and Photo Diode Arrays ([PDA](#pda)s), allowing to obtain *spectra* \footnotemark{}.
\footnotetext{Both \textit{chromatogram} and \textit{spectrum} will be explained later.}

The [UV](#uv)-[PDA](#pda) detectors are almost universal at low wavelength, their signal is relatively immune to changes of mobile phases and has a linear dynamic range of approximately 5 orders of magnitudes with a high precision (<0.2% relative standard deviation), thus making it well suited for regulatory analysis [@url:https://www.chromatographyonline.com/view/ultraviolet-detectors-perspectives-principles-and-practices].
However, to be detected, analytes have to contain chromophores to be detected, and the signal intensity can vary greatly depending on these chromphores (high variability for different comopunds).
Finally, the structural information obtained from [UV](#uv) spectra is low.

#### The *Charged Metabolome* (Mass Spectrometry)

The principle of Mass Spectrometry ([MS](#ms)) is to separate ions according to their mass to charge ratio ([*m/z*](#mz)).
Therefore, the process that takes place in a [MS](#ms) detector can be divided in two parts:
First, the ionization process, where the ions are generated, and second, the separation of the ions in a high vacuum, driven by electric and magnetic fields.

Thus, to be detected, a compound must be ionized.
This can be done with the use of various ionization techniques, which are generally divided into *soft* and *hard*.
While hard ionization techniques, leading to high fragmentation, are mainly used in [GC](#gc) analyses, the most used techniques in [LC](#lc)-[MS](#ms) are atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and electrospray ([ESI](#esi)).
Both can be considered as complementary, as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization is best suited for the analysis of compounds wiht low to intermediate polarity, whereas [ESI](#esi) aims at analyzing larger compounds with intermediate to high polarity [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.02.049].

Since [ESI](#esi) was almost exclusively used for this work, its main steps are detailed hereafter.
First, charged droplets are created at the end of the capillary coming from the [LC](#lc).
These droplets are either positively or negatively charged, depending on the polarity of the applied voltage.
The solvent constituing the droplets is gradually evaporated, leading to gas phase ions [@doi:10.1021/ac302789c].
The ions are then transfered to the mass analyzer by means of an electric field [@doi:10.1002/mas.10008].

As previously mentioned, the purpose of the mass analyzer is to separate the different gas‐phase ions, transferred from the ionization source. Many different mass analyzers are currently available on the market, such as the quadrupole (Q), the ion trap (IT), the time of flight (TOF), the Orbitrap© and the Fourier‐transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR). Tandem mass spectrometers (i.e. combinations of mass analyzers) are also commercialized and widely used, namely the triple quadrupole (QqQ), quadrupole time‐of‐flight (QqTOF) and quadrupole ion trap (QTrap). The analyzers are generally characterized by their resolving power:
In equation (5), m is the mass of the ion and Δm is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the corresponding peak on the MS spectra. The mass analyzers are classified in two groups. The low‐ resolution mass analyzers have a revolving power below 10,000, and the high‐resolution mass analyzers higher than 10,000. Another important parameter of mass analyzers is the mass accuracy (given in ppm), which represents the trueness of the measurements (difference between the mass measured by the analyzer and the real mass).
The Q, QqQ and IT analyzers have a low resolution and are, consequently, unable to separate compounds with the same nominal mass. This type of analyzer is generally used for targeted analysis, possibly quantitative. On the other hand, the high‐resolution mass analyzers (TOF, Orbitrap and FTICR) are mainly used for untargeted analysis, in which the purpose is the structural identification of unknown analytes, thanks to the determination of the exact mass.

One specific precursor ion is selected in the first quadrupole, fragmented in the collision cell, and another specific fragment issued from the dissociation is monitored in the third quadrupole. This strategy gives a much higher selectivity to the detection and, consequently, a better sensitivity to the method, thanks to the reduction of the background noise. When this mode is applied to several transitions (several product ions from one or several precursor ions) within the same analysis, the designation “multiple reaction monitoring” (MRM) is employed. The other modes occur when at least one of the two active quadrupoles is in scan mode. When the third quadrupole is in scan mode, the mode is called “product ion scan” and all the fragments of a selected precursor ion are analyzed. It is used to obtain structural information or to assess the best SRM transition for a given analyte. When the first quadrupole is in scan mode, the mode is called “precursor ion scan”. It determines the different precursor ions generating the same specific fragment, to highlight possible affiliation to the same family of molecules [61,62]. Finally, the last mode is called “neutral loss scan” and is more scarcely used. In this mode, both quadrupoles are set in scan mode but shifted by a pre‐defined neutral mass, in order to highlight a neutral fragment common to several compounds [63].

8.4.4 Orbitrap Analyzer
The orbitrap is the most recent mass analyzer, developed by Makarov in 2000 [44,45] and commercialized in 2005. In few words, the orbitrap mass analyzer operates by radially trapping ions around a central electrode. This mass analyzer only uses electrostatic fields (DC) to confine and analyze ions. The m/z values are finally measured from the frequency of harmonic oscillations of ions, along the axis of the elec- tric field.
The orbitrap analyzer offers very high resolving power in the range 100,000􏱜240,000, and excellent mass accuracy below 1 ppm. In addition, it possesses a high space charge capacity which makes this instrument suitable for tackling the most difficult analytical problems. However, this instrument remains quite expensive and difficult to use, at least for beginners. Another drawback of orbitrap analyzers is its low acquisition rate, compared to quadrupole and TOF instruments, which makes them incompatible (at least for the first generation) with the narrow peaks produced in UHPSFC. Up to now, it has only been used in a few SFC- MS applications [46􏱜48], dealing with the determination of pesticides, oil sands profiling, and lipidomics.

8.4.5 Tandem Mass Analyzers
The MS/MS uses two stages of analyzers, to examine selectively the fragmentation of isolated ions. The coupling of two analyzers in series (also known as tandem MS) can be done with the same analyzer (QqQ) or two different analyzers (QqTOF), which are known as hybrid instru- ments. For dissociation experiments, the most common activation method is collision induced dissociation (CID), where an inert gas is introduced into a collision cell where low energy (10􏱜100 eV) and colli- sions occur between the precursor ion and the molecules of inert gas.
Today, the most widely used MS/MS instrument for trace analysis in complicated matrices is the triple quadrupole (QqQ), where the first and third quadrupoles are mass selective devices and the second serves as a collision cell. The QqQ is particularly useful for quantitative analy- sis, due to its ability to work in the highly selective single reaction mon- itoring (SRM) mode. In the SRM mode, the sensitivity is excellent, and very high acquisition rates (down to ,1ms per transition) can be reached for quantitative analysis of complex multicomponent mixtures.
An alternative to QqQ is the QqTOF where the third quadrupole is replaced with a TOF analyzer. One of the main advantage of QqTOF instruments over QqQ is the high resolving power of TOF, typically in the range 20,000􏱜40,000. As a result, interfering peaks from ions having the same nominal mass can be resolved, thus improving the signal-to- noise ratio.
Tandem mass analyzers (QqQ and QqTOF) have become more popu- lar in recent years and are the most widely used instruments for SFC-MS operation today [49􏱜54].

<!-- LUCA
Mass analyzers are fundamental, since their role is to guarantee the discrimination between the different ions that have been previously generated in the MS ionization source.
Mass analyzers are classified according to their resolution power, following equation 3:
where m is the ion’s mass and Dm is the resolution or full width at half maximum (FWHM).
Using equation 2, it has been possible to classify mass analyzers in two main groups: those with a resolution power < 10 000, called low-resolution mass analyzers, and those with a resolution power > 10 000 (high-resolution mass analyzers).
In the first group quadrupole (Q), and ion trap (IT) analyzers are present.
These are not capable to discriminate ions with the same nominal mass, due to the unit resolution they offer.
In compensation, they are able to provide excellent performance in the context of targeted analyses, especially when quantification is needed.
High resolution mass analyzers, such as time-of-flight (TOF) or Orbitrap©, are capable in separating ions down to 0.001 atomic mass unit of difference and are, therefore, mainly used in untargeted analyses to obtain information regarding the structure of unknown analytes.
In this thesis work, single quadrupole, triple quadrupole and time-of-flight analyzers have been employed.
