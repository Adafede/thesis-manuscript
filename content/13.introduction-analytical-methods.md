## Analytical Methods {#sec:anal}

After the previously mentioned methods, the next logical step is to detect what constitutes the  *extracted* metabolome (see Figure @fig:intro-metabolomes).

### The *Detected Metabolome*

This section discusses the different types of detectors that can be used  for the analysis of an extract.
As a preliminary note, these detectors generate different types of data and none of them alone can detect *all* [NP](#np)s [@doi:10.1055/s-0028-1088393; @doi:10.1002/jssc.200900152].

#### The *Colored Metabolome* ([UV](#uv)-visible & Photo Diode Array)

The historical detector in [NP](#np) chemistry is the ultraviolet([UV](#uv))-visible detector.
It can typically acquire in the 190-600nm range, thus covering partially both the [UV](#uv) (10-400nm) and visible (380-750nm) domains.
Before this detector, compounds were often analyzed on [TLC](#tlc) sprayed with specific reagents to reveal them [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.12.068], as the detector was the human eye.

The first [UV](#uv)-visible detectors were able to acquire at a single wavelength only.
The result of a classical single [LC](#lc)-[UV](#uv) analysis was called a *chromatogram*.
Later on, multiple wavelengths could be acquired simultaneously with Photo Diode Arrays ([PDA](#pda)s), allowing to obtain *spectra* across the chromatogram\footnotemark{}.
\footnotetext{Both \textit{chromatogram} and \textit{spectrum} will be explained later.}

The [UV](#uv)-[PDA](#pda) detectors are almost universal at low wavelength, and have a linear dynamic range of approximately 5 orders of magnitudes with a high precision (<0.2% relative standard deviation).
Because of its cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and overall versatility, [LC](#lc)-[UV](#uv) is well suited for regulatory analysis [@url:https://www.chromatographyonline.com/view/ultraviolet-detectors-perspectives-principles-and-practices].
However, analytes have to contain chromophores to be detected, and the signal intensity can vary greatly depending on these chromophores (high variability for different compounds).
Finally, the structural information obtained from [UV](#uv) spectra is low but can help with the chemical class attribution in the case of [NP](#np)s with specific chromophores.

#### The *Charged Metabolome* (Mass Spectrometry)

The principle of Mass Spectrometry ([MS](#ms)) is to separate ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio ([*m/z*](#mz)).
Therefore, the process that takes place in a [MS](#ms) detector can be divided into two parts:
First, the ionization process, where the ions are generated, and second, the separation of the ions in a high vacuum, driven by electric and magnetic fields.

Thus, to be detected, a compound must be ionized.
This can be done with the use of various ionization techniques, which are generally divided into *soft* and *hard*.
While hard ionization techniques, leading to high fragmentation, are mainly used in [GC](#gc) analyses, the most used techniques in [LC](#lc)-[MS](#ms) are atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and electrospray ([ESI](#esi)).
Both can be considered complementary [@doi:10.1021/ac701982e], as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization is best suited for the analysis of compounds with low to intermediate polarity, whereas [ESI](#esi) aims at analyzing larger compounds with intermediate to high polarity [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.02.049].

Since [ESI](#esi) was almost exclusively used for this work, its main steps are detailed hereafter.
First, charged droplets are created at the end of the capillary coming from the [LC](#lc).
These droplets are either positively or negatively charged, depending on the polarity of the applied voltage.
The solvent constituting the droplets is gradually evaporated, leading to gas phase ions [@doi:10.1021/ac302789c].
The ions are then transferred to the mass analyzer by means of an electric field [@doi:10.1002/mas.10008].

As for ionization methods, multiple types of mass analyzers exist.
They are generally divided into *low* (quadrupoles, ion traps) and *high* (Time of flight, Orbitrap [@doi:10.1002/jms.856; @doi:10.1021/ac991131p], Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance) resolving power.
The resolving power corresponds to the mass of an ion divided by the full width at half maximum ([FWHM](#fwhm)) of its corresponding peak.
Resolving power of less than 10,000 is considered *low* resolution and higher values as *high* resolution.
Low-resolution analyzers are better suited for quantitative analysis, while high-resolution analyzers, which can determine the mass with 0.001 mass unit precision, and thus exact mass, are better suited for qualitative, untargeted analysis.
A [UHPLC](#uhplc)-[ESI](#esi)-Orbitrap [@doi:10.1021/ac0258047] setup was used for this work mainly, with some more details explained below.

##### The *Fragmented Metabolome* (Tandem Mass Spectrometry)

As the analysis aimed at the structural annotation (qualification) of the highest possible number of compounds, fragmentation spectra were acquired.
Multiple ways exist to obtain fragmentation spectra.
While some exotic experiments were performed, the best compromise actually remains the alternation of full scans with Data Dependent Acquisition ([DDA](#dda)) [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04491].
In this mode, fragmentation spectra are obtained by the isolation of a precursor ion, which is then fragmented.
This precursor ion is usually the most abundant of the ions detected in full scan mode and is placed for some time on a dynamic exclusion list for some time to fragment other, less intense, ions.
The fragmentation spectra contain more structural information than full scan spectra.
However, full scan spectra and their isotopic patterns, sometimes with some adducts or in-source fragments are of great help in retrieving the correct structural annotation.

While [MS](#ms) is the more versatile detector in terms of structural annotation, the ionization behavior, in particular in [ESI](#esi), is heavily structure-dependent (as previously for [UV](#uv)).
For this reason, coupling to another, more generic detector to assess quantities more accurately the amounts seems a good idea.

#### The *Semi-quantified Metabolome*

True quantification is time-consuming, expensive, and requires the use of (possibly deuterated) standards, which makes it unusable for untargeted analysis.
This is why detectors giving responses that are ideally independent of the analyte and the mobile phase are needed.
One of the oldest detectors of that type is the Flame Ionization Detector ([FID](#fid)), even if some adjustments to the response factor are still needed [@doi:10.1002/ffj.3098].
While some experimental [LC](#lc)-[FID](#fid) setups exist [@doi:10.1016/j.talanta.2019.120229], the most used "generic" detectors in [LC](#lc) analyses are the Evaporative Light Scattering Detector ([ELSD](#elsd)) [@doi:10.1021/np300034c; @doi:10.3390/molecules24020323] and the Charged Aerosol Detector ([CAD](#cad)) [@doi:10.1007/s11419-017-0392-7; @doi:10.1016/j.jpba.2018.09.029].

##### Evaporative Light Scattering Detector

Similarly to [ESI](#esi), the mobile phase is first nebulized into droplets [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.080].
The droplets are then sprayed through a heated drift tube where the solvent and volatile substances are evaporated. 
Therefore, only compounds less volatile than the solvent are likely to be detected.
The non-volatile compounds then pass a light beam and the scattering of light is measured.
The scattering is proportional to the amount of compounds present, but also to their size. Therefore, large compounds are overestimated, the same way as compounds eluting at high percentages of organic (volatile) solvent if no make-up pump is used.
Some proposals were made to compensate for those limitations [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2007.05.101; @doi:10.1021/cc990068e].
Besides these limitations, [ELSD](#elsd) remains a detector of choice for compounds without chromophores, such as sugars and lipids, or poorly ionized.

##### Charged Aerosol Detector

[CAD](#cad) uses the same nebulizing principle as [ELSD](#elsd), but the detection is made through the measurement of corona-charged ions through an ion trap.
This makes it slightly more sensitive than [ELSD](#elsd) [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.080; @doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.04.047; @doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2011.01.062].
It has also be shown, in a limited range, to be more sensitive than [UV](#uv) [@doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2010.09.056].

### The *Qualified Metabolome*

The qualitative analysis of metabolites was defined as "the transition of complex data into metabolite information with biological significance" [@doi:10.1007/978-94-017-9291-2_7].
While this definition has a very precise goal, the process can be divided into smaller parts.

#### The *Annotated Metabolome*

The first part consists in annotating a spectrum with any qualitative information.
This process is known as *annotation*.
While the current acceptance of this term in metabolomics is mainly seen as "structural annotation", the annotation could be of any type.
For example, it could be calculating some mass differences among observed ions, as first observation, or any other *tag* [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03705.x].
Alternatively, in [GC](#gc)-olfactometry for example [@doi:10.1016/j.foodres.2018.07.037], it could be to attribute an odor to a given range of the chromatogram.
It could also be "*already seen in sample X*", which, in [NP](#np) chemistry, is known as *dereplication*.
*Metabolite annotation* is a less complete process than metabolite identification, which requires full structural elucidation [@doi:10.3389/fpls.2019.01329].

##### The *Dereplicated Metabolome*

The meaning of "dereplication", even in [NP](#np) chemistry only, evolved greatly over the years [@doi:10.1007/s11101-015-9448-7; @doi:10.1039/c4np00134f].
It can be linked or not to metabolomics strategies [@doi:10.1002/9781119427896.ch7].
In their review from 2015 [@doi:10.1007/s11101-015-9448-7], the authors first make a distinction between [MS](#ms) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ([NMR](#nmr)) [@doi:10.1002/minf.201700027] -based dereplication.
They then identify five distinct dereplication categories.
One of them is the rapid annotation of the major compounds of an extract, no matter their chemical class.
This definition is probably the most suited for this work, with the *nuance* it does not need to necessarily be major compounds only.

To be able to dereplicate an extract, the strongest dependency is the availability of a library of known compounds.
This can be an internal library of standards, ideally with comparable retention times depending on the chromatographic system used, or a publicly available library.
The dereplication process usually involves a molecular formula determination, eventually a spectral matching step [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03434.x], eventually complemented with other orthogonal information [@doi:10.1007/s11306-014-0739-6].
These different levels of sophistication, lead to different levels of confidence and annotation quality [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0007490].
The levels defined by Sumner et al. in 2014 are:\
«*1. Confident identifications are based upon a minimum of two orthogonal data relative to an authentic standard.\
2. Putatively annotated compounds (e.g. without chemical reference standards, based upon physicochemical properties and/or spectral similarity with public/commercial spectral libraries).
3. Putatively characterized compound classes (e.g. based upon characteristic physicochemical properties of a chemical class of compounds, or by spectral similarity to known compounds of a chemical class).\
4. Unknown compounds—although unidentified or unclassified these metabolites can still be differentiated and quantified based upon spectral data.*» [@doi:10.1007/s11306-014-0739-6]

Another, more granular, definition based on the same principles of these levels was proposed recently [@doi:10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00206].
The main limitation of dereplication is the size and quality of the library used for annotation.
The annotation of compounds that are not present in databases is therefore a major challenge.

##### The *De novo Metabolome*

While some frameworks exist to *extend* the coverage of databases, they still rely on the initial compounds present in the database initially [@doi:10.1186/s13321-015-0087-1; @doi:10.1038/nmeth.4512; @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btac331].
To annotate *novel* compounds, the main tool remained for long human reasoning, but here again, mainly based on previous knowledge.
A true paradigm shift in this respect was recently introduced by MSNovelist [@doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01486-3].
MSNovelist is able to generate structures from fragmentation spectra, this without a reference library.
It thus appears to be a perfect complement to library-based annotation, also allowing it to best guide the complete structural elucidation.

#### The *Identified Metabolome* (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance & Other Spectroscopic Methods)

As previously mentioned, the formal *identification* of a compound requires more than [MS](#ms) only.
The structural elucidation of [NP](#np)s requires their isolation through chromatographic methods followed by, at least, [NMR](#nmr) methods [@doi:10.1039/C2NP20104F].
One of the advantages of [NMR](#nmr) over [MS](#ms) is its quantitative response, which is only dependent on the molecular mass of the compound.
Even if less sensible than [MS](#ms), [NMR](#nmr) now allows the elucidation of [NP](#np)s at the nanogram scale [@doi:10.1039/b920545b].
Together, [MS](#ms) and [NMR](#nmr) are an efficient combination for the structural elucidation of [NP](#np)s [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05112].
Despite the help of computer-assisted decision tools [@doi:10.1002/mrc.4612] and [MS](#ms), the correct identification of a structure through [NMR](#nmr) is highly challenging and multiple [NP](#np)s structures are revised and reassigned each year [@doi:10.1021/acs.joc.8b01027; @doi:10.1002/anie.200460864].

Finally, for absolute configuration determination and thus complete identification in the case of possible stereoisomerism, complementary chiroptical methods such as electronic circular dichroism [@doi:10.1007/s11418-013-0768-x] and/or X-ray crystallography [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-05275-5_1] are required.
Another more recent technique, microcrystal electron diffraction [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0395-x], holds promise to help structural elucidation of mixtures of [NP](#np)s [@doi:10.1039/D0NP00035C].
Only *identified* compounds can then be accurately quantified, either per [NMR](#nmr) or with the help of (deuterated) standards.

### The *Quantified Metabolome*

At the end of the whole process, some *identified* metabolites can finally be *quantified*.
This implies very meticulous experiments, that can be carried out on a few metabolites only [@doi:10.1038/s41592-021-01197-1].
This limitation is not only due to the number of identified metabolites but also to technical limitations, such as the matrix effect [@doi:10.1007/s11306-019-1597-z], which results in ion suppression when too many ions are measured at once.
Quantitative experiments should include uncertainty estimation [@doi:10.1002/9783527655861.ch3], recovery calculation [@doi:10.1016/j.ab.2010.04.031], and generally stable isotope labeling [@doi:10.2174/138920111795909096], thus requiring the living organism.
For this reason, except for model organisms, quantitative experiments are usually performed on mammalian cells or microbes [@doi:10.3390/metabo10020074] and are extremely rare in plant chemistry.
