<!-- To identify the taste differences induced by vatting, a wine that has undergone post-fermentation maceration (PFM) is compared to the same wine without macera- tion. These wines are fractionated according to the same protocol. Different methods are used together, solid phase extraction (SPE) fractionation and liquid-liquid extrac- tion (ELL, and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). The taste comparison of the fractions from the both modalities made it possible to highlight several fractions where the sweetness was perceived more intense for the PFM modality. The use of molecular networks in conjunction with tasting notes helps to highlight sweet-tasting compounds.

These findings demonstrate the presence of sweet-tasting molecules released from grape seeds into wine, thereby confirming the empirical observations of the old winemaking manuals. An inductive approach guided by gustatometry was used to fractionate a grape-seed macerate. This protocol led to the isolation and identification of five sweet-tasting compounds. Indeed, their addition to a hydro-alcoholic solution and to a white or red wine clearly impacted the taste balance by increasing the sweetness. Fractionations of the other prepurified extracts (data not shown) did not demonstrate any other sweet-tasting molecules in seeds. Nevertheless, the presence of such molecules cannot be ruled out owing to perceptual interactions that could mask their sensory properties. -->

<!-- Among the isolated sweet-tasting molecules, two are described for the first time: H3MP-G and H4MP-G. Additionally, epi-DPA-G is reported for the first time in grapes and in wines, while AG-Glc has already been reported in white grapes but never in wine. The establishment of their detection threshold and quantification studies would allow their sensory impact on wine taste to be determined. Moreover, this research opens promising perspectives. A study of the levels of these new markers during ripening would throw light on the conditions modulating their accumulation in grapes. Furthermore, the evolution of their concentrations during winemaking and ageing would provide useful data about their extraction and stability. Beyond the gain in fundamental knowledge, such studies could have practical consequences and lead to recommendations for winemakers. -->

<!-- This study reports the first identification of astilbin stereoisomers in wine. Isoastilbin, neoastilbin and neoisoastilbin were synthesized to allow the study of their sensory properties in wine. Their addition to a wine modified the taste balance by increasing the perceived sweetness, whose intensity varied according to the stereochemistry. Neoastilbin and neoisoastilbin were the most active compounds.

Thanks to the development and validation of an LC-HRMS analytical method, astilbin stereoisomers were identified and quantified for the first time in 63 commercial wines from different regions and different vintages. Astilbin was the predominant isomer in all the wines with an average concentration of 9.10 mg/L, while the other isomers were quantified at concentrations of the order of mg/L. Analysis of a series of vintages from two wineries revealed higher levels of astilbin, and especially neoastilbin, in old wines than in young ones. On the contrary, astilbin was generally more abundant in young wines. These results suggest that the isomerization of astilbin occurs during bottle ageing and leads mainly to the formation of neoastilbin, which is a trans isomer and might be thermodynamically more stable than isoastilbin and neoisoastilbin. Interestingly, neoastilbin and neoisoastilbin are sweeter than astilbin, so the isomerization of astilbin might be related to the gain in sweetness often observed in old wines.

Beyond providing new knowledge on the molecular origin of the sweet taste of dry wine, this study offers promising perspectives. Further studies are required to determine the impact of grape variety and winemaking practices on the presence of astilbin and its isomers. The determination of the gustatory detection thresholds of all isomers will be an asset to evaluate the influence of astilbin isomerization during aging on the taste balance of old wines. -->
