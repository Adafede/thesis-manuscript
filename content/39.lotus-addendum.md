## Addendum {#addendum-lotus .page_break_before .unnumbered}

After its publication, the Chapter @sec:lotus has led to multiple reuses and enhancements, some of which will be detailed here briefly.
These developments have been driven by the needs of the various communities using the *Lotus Initiative* data and are constantly evolving.


The first improvement made was a more elaborated PubChem integration.
Each released version of LOTUS is archived on Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/communities/the-lotus-initiative/>) and integrated automatically on a monthly basis into PubChem.
This is part of the "Bridging Biology and Chemistry through Target-Centric Views of PubChem Data" [@doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167514].
The user can make requests through PubChem [API](#api), or query manually, with the help of chemical and biological trees to refine his query (<https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classification/#hid=115>).

There is still some on-going work on [LNPN](#lnpn) (<https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/>).
Part of this work consists in a better Bioregistry
