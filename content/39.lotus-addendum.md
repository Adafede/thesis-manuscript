## Addendum {#addendum-lotus .page_break_before .unnumbered .unlisted}

After its publication, the Chapter @sec:lotus has led to multiple reuses and improvements, some of which will be briefly detailed here.
These developments were driven by various communities using the *Lotus Initiative* data and are constantly evolving.

The first improvement made was a more elaborated PubChem integration.
Each released version of LOTUS is archived on Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/communities/the-lotus-initiative/>) and integrated automatically on a monthly basis into PubChem.
This is part of the "Bridging Biology and Chemistry through Target-Centric Views of PubChem Data" [@doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167514].
The user can make requests through PubChem [API](#api), or query manually, with the help of chemical and biological trees to refine his query (<https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classification/#hid=115>).

Work is still in progress on [LNPN](#lnpn) (<https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/>).
Part of this work consists in a better Bioregistry [@doi:10.1101/2022.07.08.499378] integration (see <https://bioregistry.io/registry/lotus>).
In addition, over the months, more elaborated queries than the one described in the publication and available at <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Chemistry/Natural_products#Queries> were written. 
A repository was created to keep track of the queries written for different projects and applications (<https://github.com/Adafede/sparql>).
The queries were written with headers to facilitate their transposition outside of Wikidata.
The daily updated results of one of these queries can be found at <https://adafede.github.io/wd-np-up-to-date/>.
As stated at the end of the publication, ways to ease curation are in development.

One last example on how the data of the *Lotus Initiative* was quickly integrated into the larger [NP](#np) ecosystem is described in [@doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-zvjnj].
It corresponds to the prediction of [NMR](#nmr) spectra in silico from the structures present in LOTUS v7 [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.6582124].
These predictions, proposed by Jean-Marc Nuzillard, are now available at <https://nmrshiftdb.nmr.uni-koeln.de/>.
The original idea of a taxonomy-focused [NP](#np) [DB](#db) for [NMR](#nmr)-based dereplication was described in 2021 [@doi:10.3390/analytica2030006].
