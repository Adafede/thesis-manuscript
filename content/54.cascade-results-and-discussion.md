## Results and Discussion {.page_break_before}

This section is structured as follows: 
First, an overview of the process is illustrated.
The main technical elements are then detailed.
Then, the different results of the process are illustrated and the added value of the approach is demonstrated for a case study, *Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H. Karst.
In addition, the consistency of the results with the literature is detailed, and some borderline cases are finally presented.

### Workflow

A scheme of the general workflow is presented in Figure @fig:cascade-1.

![**Schematic view of the presented workflow** After the LC-MS/MS-CAD acquisition, the data are subjected to several processing steps. On the CAD side, a first pre-processing step is performed to enhance the signal. Then, peaks are automatically detected and integrated. On the MS/MS side, features are detected, grouped according to Ion Identity Networking and clustered into a Molecular Network. They are then annotated at the chemical class and/or structure level. The CAD peaks and MS features are then linked together by a peak shape similarity calculation. An additional feature filtering step based on the knowledge of the sample can be performed. This provides combined qualitative and semi-quantitative information that can be explored in multiple ways.](images/cascade_workflow.pdf "cascade-1"){#fig:cascade-1 short-caption="Schematic view of the presented workflow" width="100%"}

As a minimal input, the workflow requires LC-MS/MS data, supplemented by another detector (here CAD and PDA).
Multiple processing step then follow, and will be detailed in the next subchapters.
First, signals are aligned as described in [Signals Alignment](#signals-alignment).
Being very noisy, the CAD required additional processing as described in [CAD Processing](#charged-aerosol-detector-cad-processing).
After several signal processing steps described below, a qualitative and semi-quantitative report is generated, as well as visual means to interrogate the data.
In parallel, MS features are extracted, clustered and annotated, as described in [MS/MS Processing](#tandem-mass-spectrometry-msms-processing).
Afterwards, MS features are attributed to CAD peaks as described in [Link Between CAD and MS Data](#link-between-cad-and-ms-data).
Finally, different automated numerical and visual reports are generated as described in [Illustration of the Results](#illustration-of-the-results).

### Data Processing

#### Signals Alignment

The first necessary step was to align the signals of the different detectors. 
In the configuration used, the nondestructive PDA detector was placed first, before the split.
The delay of the PDA signal was 0.055 minutes and that of the MS signal was 0.090 minutes, respectively.
These values were used to align the signals as shown in Figure @fig:cascade-2.

![**Alignment of the different signals after preprocessing of each signal.** All signals were preprocessed to improve the downstream steps. CAD and PDA signals are at the top, in red and green, respectively. MS signals (positive and negative modes) are at the bottom, in light and dark blue, respectively. A zoomed-in area showing the different intensities normalized to the observed signal is also shown.](images/cascade_example_chromatogram.pdf "cascade-2"){#fig:cascade-2 short-caption="Alignment of the different signals after preprocessing of each signal" width="100%"}

Figure @fig:cascade-2 highlights the complementarity between each signal obtained.
While the PDA intensity approximately follows the CAD intensity when a signal is present, some major molecules without a chromophore are ignored if only UV is used.
The same is true for MS ionization modes.
Although the presented approach also works with only one polarity, it is highly recommended to use both to improve coverage.

#### Charged Aerosol Detector (CAD) Processing

As CAD signal was very noisy, it required some preprocessing steps before peak extraction. 
These are briefly described hereafter and more in details in the related Materials and Methods section.
First, a Fourrier transform was performed, to keep only 1% of the components.
Fourier transform techniques to reduce noise were already demonstrated as powerful. [@doi:10.1016/j.trac.2021.116354]
This already allowed to greatly lower signal interferences.
Moreover, chromatographic resolution was improved using derivative enhancement approach as described in [@doi:10.1016/j.talanta.2018.09.048].
This resulted in a sharper signal, where peak detection could be performed with better results than on the raw signal. 
To ensure best possible alignment, this was also done on the other signals.

Peaks were then detected using relatively simple algorithmic as CAD signal contains only one dimension, thus not allowing for much more elaborated techniques.
A comparison of the peaks detected automatically before and after signal processing is shown below.

![**Comparison of peak detection on raw and processed signal.** The results of the automated peak picking on the raw signal are shown on the top. Only two peaks are detected, and heavily splitted. The results of the peak picking on the processed signal are shown at the bottom. Almost no peaks are lost and very few with small shoulders are split.](images/cascade-3.pdf "cascade-3"){#fig:cascade-3 short-caption="Comparison of peak detection on raw and processed signal" width="100%"}

DEVELOP


#### Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) Processing

##### Features Extraction 

MS features were extracted using Sirius 5.7.0. 
The main advantage was it did not require any parameter, thus making optimal for automation.
As the peak picking algorithmic and adduct recognition was written by the authors of the tool themselfes, downstream steps performed better.
Trials using MZmine 3.1.0 were performed to obtain IIN informed MGF files, but they led to worse performance (data not shown).
Peakonly was also used, but its integration with the rest of the workfllow, needing finely defined isotope patterns, also led to worsed performance.
Finally, some tests were performed using SLAW, but they did not reached the performance of Sirius.
Integration of MZmine3 and IIN in SLAW in the future might improve a lot its performance and speed.

The MGF was used to build an MN through the GNPS platform.

(SEE GNPS job id) `//TODO`{.red} 

Using the MS1 adduct module of TIMA v XXX `//TODO`{.red}, adducts, multimers, and fragments generated by the same molecule could be annotated as such, even without structural annotation.

A schematic figure illustrating how this was performed is proposed in Figure @fig:cascade-3.
Such attribution complements well with the one of Sirius for NP-specific neutral losses or multiply charged molecules.

`//TODO`{.red}

##### Features Annotation 

MS features were annotated using Sirius 5.7.0. 
The obtained annotations were then complemented with annotations coming from the GNPS libraries, together with ISDB-LOTUS.
The combination of the annotations of all three tools were then submitted to taxonomically informed metabolite annotation.

All details are given in M&Ms

In positive mode, this led to XXX `//TODO`{.red} annotations on XXX `//TODO`{.red} features.
In negative mode, this led to XXX `//TODO`{.red} annotations on XXX `//TODO`{.red} features.
More details are given in Table @tbl:cascade-1 below.

### Literature Matching

`//TODO`{.red}

As an approximation of compounds present in the extracts, a query of reported compounds in the producing organism was performed on Wikidata, which is now the largest occurrences resource for natural products.
The returned list of compounds for each producing organism was then filtered to better match the LC-MS run conditions 

`//TODO`{.red} (see Material and Methods).

Comparison between the composition obtained by LC-MS and the one reported in the literature is illustrated below.
