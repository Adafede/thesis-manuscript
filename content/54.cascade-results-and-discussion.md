## Results and Discussion {.page_break_before}

This section is structured as follows: 
First, an overview of the process is illustrated.
The main technical elements are then detailed.
Then, the different results of the process are illustrated and the added value of the approach is demonstrated for a case study, *Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H. Karst.
In addition, the consistency of the results with the literature is detailed, and some borderline cases are finally presented.

### Workflow

A schema of the general workflow is presented in Figure @fig:cascade-1.

![**Schematic view of the presented workflow** After the LC-MS/MS-CAD acquisition, the data are subjected to several processing steps. On the CAD side, a first pre-processing step is performed to enhance the signal. Then, peaks are automatically detected and integrated. On the MS/MS side, features are detected, grouped according to Ion Identity Networking and clustered into a Molecular Network. They are then annotated at the chemical class and/or structure level. The CAD peaks and MS features are then linked together by a peak shape similarity calculation. An additional feature filtering step based on the knowledge of the sample can be performed. This provides combined qualitative and semi-quantitative information that can be explored in multiple ways.](images/cascade_workflow.pdf "cascade-1"){#fig:cascade-1 short-caption="Schematic view of the presented workflow" width="100%"}

As a minimal input, the workflow requires LC-MS/MS data, supplemented by another detector (here CAD and PDA).
After several signal processing steps described below, a qualitative and semi-quantitative report is generated, as well as visual means to interrogate the data.

### Data Processing

#### Signals Alignment

The first necessary step was to align the signals of the different detectors. 
In the configuration used, the nondestructive PDA detector was placed first, before the split.
The delay of the PDA signal was 0.055 minutes and that of the MS signal was 0.090 minutes, respectively.
These values were used to align the signals as shown in Figure @fig:cascade-2.

![**Alignment of the different signals after preprocessing of each signal** All signals were preprocessed to improve the downstream steps. CAD and PDA signals are at the top, in red and green, respectively. MS signals (positive and negative modes) are at the bottom, in light and dark blue, respectively. A zoomed-in area showing the different intensities normalized to the observed signal is also shown.](images/cascade_example_chromatogram.pdf "cascade-2"){#fig:cascade-2 short-caption="Alignment of the different signals after preprocessing of each signal" width="100%"}

Figure @fig:cascade-2 highlights the complementarity between each signal obtained.
While the PDA intensity approximately follows the CAD intensity when a signal is present, some major molecules without a chromophore are ignored if only UV is used.
The same is true for MS ionization modes.
Although the presented approach also works with only one polarity, it is highly recommended to use both to improve coverage.

#### Charged Aerosol Detector (CAD) Processing

As CAD signal was very noisy, it required some preprocessing steps before peak extraction. 
These are briefly described hereafter and more in details in the related Materials and Methods section.
First, a Fourrier transform was performed, to keep only 5% of the components.
Fourier transform techniques to reduce noise were already demonstrated as powerful. [@doi:10.1016/j.trac.2021.116354]
This already allowed to greatly lower signal interferences.
Moreover, chromatographic resolution was improved using derivative enhancement approach as described in [@doi:10.1016/j.talanta.2018.09.048].
This resulted in a sharper signal, where peak detection could be performed with better results than on the raw signal. (SEE SUPPL) `//TODO`{.red}
To ensure best possible alignment, this was also done on the other signals.
Peaks were then detected using relatively simple algorithmic (SEE M&M) `//TODO`{.red} to be fast, as CAD signal contains only one dimension, thus not allowing for much more elaborated techniques.

#### Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) Processing

##### Features Extraction 

MS features were extracted using MZmine 3.xx  `//TODO`{.red}.
All parameters are available in the M&M. `//TODO`{.red}
Features were grouped using Ion Identity Networking and a MN built with the resulting list.
Already before annotation, features belonging to a same "group" could therefore be spotted, as illustrated in Figure @fig:cascade-3.

### Literature Matching

 `//TODO`{.red}
As an approximation of compounds present in the extracts, a query of reported compounds in the producing organism was performed on Wikidata, which is now the largest occurrences resource for natural products.
The returned list of compounds for each producing organism was then filtered to better match the LC-MS run conditions (see Material and Methods).

Comparison between the composition obtained by LC-MS and the one reported in the literature is illustrated below.
