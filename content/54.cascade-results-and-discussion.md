## Results and Discussion {.page_break_before}

This section is structured as follows: 
First, an overview of the process is illustrated.
The main technical elements are then detailed.
Then, the different outputs of the workflow are illustrated and the added value of the approach is demonstrated for a case study, *Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H. Karst.
Further, the coherence of the results with the literature are detailed, and some edge cases are finally presented.

### Workflow

A schema of the general workflow is presented in Figure @fig:cascade-1.

![**Schematic view of the presented workflow** After LC-MS/MS-CAD acquisition, the data is submitted to multiple processing steps. On the CAD side, a first pre-processing step is performed to improve the signal. Then peaks are automatically detected and integrated. On the MS/MS side, features are detected, grouped according to Ion Identity Networking, and clustered in a Molecular Network. They are then annotated at the chemical class and/or structural level. CAD peaks and MS features are then linked together using peak-shape similarity calculation. Additional features filtering step based on knowledge of the sample can be performed. This finally leads to combined qualitative and semi-quantitative information that can be further explored in multiple ways.](images/cascade_workflow.pdf "cascade-1"){#fig:cascade-1 short-caption="Schematic view of the presented workflow" width="100%"}

As minimal input, the workflow requires LC-MS/MS data, complemented with another detector (here CAD and PDA).
After multiple steps of signal processing described hereafter, a qualitative and semi-quantitative report is generated, together with visual ways to query the data.

### Data Processing

#### Signals Alignment

The first necessary step consisted in alignment of the signals of the different detectors. In the used setup, the non-destructive PDA detector is placed first, before the split. The delay of CAD signal was 0.055 minute and MS signal of 0.090 minute, respectively. Those values were used to align the signals as depicted in Figure @fig:cascade-2.

![**Alignment of the different signals after preprocessing of each signal** All signals were preprocessed to improve downstream steps. CAD and PDA signals are on the top, in red and green, respectively. MS signals (positive and negative modes) are on the bottom in light and dark blue, respectively. A zoom on a zone illustrating the different normalized intensities depending on the observed signal is also shown.](images/cascade_example_chromatogram.pdf "cascade-2"){#fig:cascade-2 short-caption="Alignment of the different signals after preprocessing of each signal" width="100%"}

Figure @fig:cascade-2 highlights the complementarity between each obtained signal.
While PDA's intensity follows approximately the CAD's intensity when a signal is present, some major molecules not having any chromophore are disregarded if using UV only.
Same applies to the MS ionization modes.
While the presented approach works also with only one polarity, it is strongly recommended to run both to enhance coverage.

#### Charged Aerosol Detector (CAD) Processing

As CAD signal was very noisy, it required some preprocessing steps before peak extraction. 
These are briefly described hereafter and more in details in the related Materials and Methods section.
First, a Fourrier transform was performed, to keep only 5% of the components.
Fourier transform techniques to reduce noise were already demonstrated as powerful. [@doi:10.1016/j.trac.2021.116354]
This already allowed to greatly lower signal interferences.
Moreover, chromatographic resolution was improved using derivative enhancement approach as described in [@doi:10.1016/j.talanta.2018.09.048].
This resulted in a sharper signal, where peak detection could be performed with better results than on the raw signal. (SEE SUPPL) `//TODO`{.red}
To ensure best possible alignment, this was also done on the other signals.
Peaks were then detected using relatively simple algorithmic (SEE M&M) `//TODO`{.red} to be fast, as CAD signal contains only one dimension, thus not allowing for much more elaborated techniques.

#### Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) Processing

##### Features Extraction 

MS features were extracted using MZmine 3.xx  `//TODO`{.red}.
All parameters are available in the M&M. `//TODO`{.red}
Features were grouped using Ion Identity Networking and a MN built with the resulting list.
Already before annotation, features belonging to a same "group" could therefore be spotted, as illustrated in Figure @fig:cascade-3.

### Literature Matching

 `//TODO`{.red}
As an approximation of compounds present in the extracts, a query of reported compounds in the producing organism was performed on Wikidata, which is now the largest occurrences resource for natural products.
The returned list of compounds for each producing organism was then filtered to better match the LC-MS run conditions (see Material and Methods).

Comparison between the composition obtained by LC-MS and the one reported in the literature is illustrated below.
