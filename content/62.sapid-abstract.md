### Abstract {.page_break_before}

Bitterness, among all tastes, is the most difficult to decipher.
Reasons are the chemical diversity of bitter-tasting compounds and the heterogeneous sensory response among the population.
Because of its pharmacological relevance, methodological developments are needed to decode bitterness.
Relationship among chemical concentration and taste has been shown to be highly complex [@doi:10.1093/chemse/bjl052].
For this reason, we developed an untargeted methodology to deconvolute the tastes and composition of complex plant extracts.
An ethanolic extract of *Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H.Karst., a well-known bitter plant was fractionated.
The extensive study of the fractions extract was performed through [1D](#d) and [2D](#dd) [NMR](#nmr) experiments together with untargeted [LC](#lc)[HR](#hr)[MS-MS](#msms) analysis and [CAD](#cad) detection.
After chemical clustering of the fractions, each cluster was evaluated with free sensory analysis, complemented by classical descriptive analysis [@doi:10.1016/j.foodqual.2005.01.006].
Attribution of the bitterness to well-known seco-iridoids was confirmed using untargeted methods.
Comprehensive qualitative and semi-quantitative chemical characterization of the extract also allowed to highlight the contribution of minor compounds to the overall taste.
Interesting insights into sub-threshold impact on taste were gained.
These findings should enable improved formulation of plant-based products.
