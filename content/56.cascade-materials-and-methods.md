### Plant material

The aerial parts of *S. chirayita* were furnished by Tradall SA (Batch 155174).

### Extraction

1.1kg of plant material was homogenized in a grinder and extracted at room temperature with 5kg H~2~O and 6kg EtOH for 4 days.
The extract was then filtered and stored in inox for decantation for 10 days.
Finally, the extract was concentrated under reduced pressure, freeze-dried and stored at −20°C until further use.
From 1.1kg of plant material, 86.3g of dried extract was obtained.

### Vacuum Liquid Chromatography (VLC)

The first fractionation of the extract was undertaken by Vacuum Liquid Chromatography (VLC).
10g of extract mixed with 20g of silica were loaded on a chromatographic system made of two layers of silica (50g and 200g) separated by sand.
This system was first very gently (approximately 2 drops/sec) eluted with 3x500mL 100% H2O and then 3x500mL 100% EtOH.
The aqueous and ethanolic parts were collected separately, with a “mix” part corresponding to the dead volume of the system between both and the system washed with DCM.
All VLC fractions were then concentrated under reduced pressure, freeze-dried and stored at −20°C until further use.
This procedure was repeated 3 times.
From the initial 30g of extract, a total of 27.4g were recovered (91.3%). Mass of VLC_1 (H~2~O) was 12.4g, VLC_2 (mix) was 4.2g, VLC_3 (EtOH) was 10.4g and VLC_4 (wash) 0.3g.

### Data Acquisition {#sec:mm-da}

`//TODO`{.red}

Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC system interfaced to a Q-Exactive Focus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany), using a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source.
Thermo Scientific Xcalibur 3.1 software was used for instrument control.
The LC conditions were as follows: column, Waters [BEH](#beh) C~18~ 50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 *μ*m; mobile phase, (A) water with 0.1% formic acid; (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid; flow rate, 600 *μ*l·min^−1; injection volume, 6 *μ*l; gradient, linear gradient of 5−100% B over 7 min and isocratic at 100% B for 1 min.
The optimized HESI-II parameters were as follows: source voltage, 3.5 kV (pos); sheath gas flow rate (N2), 55 units; auxiliary gas flow rate, 15 units; spare gas flow rate, 3.0; capillary temperature, 350.00°C, S-Lens RF Level, 45.
The mass analyzer was calibrated using a mixture of caffeine, methionine–arginine–phenylalanine–alanine–acetate (MRFA), sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium taurocholate, and Ultramark 1621 in an acetonitrile/methanol/water solution containing 1% formic acid by direct injection.
The data-dependent MS/MS events were performed on the three most intense ions detected in full scan MS (Top3 experiment).
The MS/MS isolation window width was 1 Da, and the stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) was set to 15, 30 and 45 units.
In data-dependent MS/MS experiments, full scans were acquired at a resolution of 35,000 FWHM (at *m/z* 200) and MS/MS scans at 17,500 FWHM both with an automatically determined maximum injection time.
After being acquired in a MS/MS scan, parent ions were placed in a dynamic exclusion list for 2.0 s.

### Data Conversion {#sec:mm-dc}

`//TODO`{.red}

The MS data were converted from .RAW (Thermo) standard data format to .mzXML format using the MSConvert software, part of the ProteoWizard package [@doi:10.1038/nbt.2377].
The converted files were treated using the MZMine software suite v. 2.38 [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-395].

#### MS-Features Extraction 

`//TODO`{.red}

The parameters were adjusted as following: the centroid mass detector was used for mass detection with the noise level set to 1.0E6 for MS level set to 1, and to 0 for MS level set to 2.
The [ADAP](#adap) chromatogram builder was used and set to a minimum group size of scans of 5, minimum group intensity threshold of 1.0E5, minimum highest intensity of 1.0E5 and *m/z* tolerance of 8.0 ppm.
For chromatogram deconvolution, the algorithm used was the wavelets ([ADAP](#adap)).
The intensity window S/N was used as S/N estimator with a signal to noise ratio set at 25, a minimum feature height at 10,000, a coefficient area threshold at 100, a peak duration ranges from 0.02 to 0.9 min and the RT wavelet range from 0.02 to 0.05 min.
Isotopes were detected using the isotopes peaks grouper with a *m/z* tolerance of 5.0 ppm, a RT tolerance of 0.02 min (absolute), the maximum charge set at 2 and the representative isotope used was the most intense.
An adduct (Na^+^ , K^+^ , NH4^+^ , CH~3~CN^+^ , CH~3~OH^+^ , C~3~H~8~O^+^ (IPA^+^ )) search was performed with the RT tolerance set at 0.1 min and the maximum relative peak height at 500%.
A complex search was also performed using \[M+H\]^+^ for [ESI](#esi) positive mode, with the RT tolerance set at 0.1 min and the maximum relative peak height at 500%.
Peak alignment was performed using the join aligner method (*m/z* tolerance at 8 ppm), absolute RT tolerance 0.065 min, weight for *m/z* at 10 and weight for RT at 10.
The peak list was gap-filled with the same RT and *m/z* range gap filler (*m/z* tolerance at 8 ppm).
Eventually the resulting aligned peaklist was filtered using the peak-list rows filter option in order to keep only features associated with MS2 scans.

##### Ion Identity Networking (IIN)

##### Feature-Based Molecular Network (FBMN)

`//TODO`{.red}

In order to keep the retention time, the exact mass information and to allow for the separation of isomers, a feature based molecular network (<https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking/>) was created using the .mgf file resulting from the MZMine pretreatment step detailed above.
Spectral data was uploaded on the GNPS molecular networking platform.
A network was then created where edges were filtered to have a cosine score above 0.7 and more than six matched peaks.
Further edges between two nodes were kept in the network if and only if each of the nodes appeared in each other’s respective top 10 most similar nodes.
The spectra in the network were then searched against GNPS’ spectral libraries.
All matches kept between network spectra and library spectra were required to have a score above 0.7 and at least six matched peaks.
The output was visualised using Cytoscape 3.6 software [@doi:10.1101/gr.1239303].
The GNPS job parameters and resulting data are available at the following address (<https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=a475a78d9ae8484b904bcad7a16abd1f>).

##### Taxonomically Informed Metabolite Annotation

`//TODO`{.red}

The spectral file (.mgf) and attributes metadata (.clustersummary) obtained after the MN step were annotated using the ISDB-DNP with the following parameters: parent mass tolerance 0.005 Da, minimum cosine score 0.2, maximal number of returned candidates: 50.
An R script was written to proceed to the *taxonomically informed scoring* on GNPS outputs and return an attribute table which can be directly loaded in Cytoscape.
The script is available online (taxo_scorer_user.Rmd) at [https://github.com/oolonek/taxo_scorer](https://github.com/oolonek/taxo_scorer).
