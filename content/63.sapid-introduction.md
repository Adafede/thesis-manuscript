### Introduction {.page_break_before}

*Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H.Karst. is a bitter plant of important medical use in India [@pmid:22556747].
It grows between 1200 and 3200m in the Himalayan range [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0090637].
As it is attributed a significant amount of medicinal properties [@pmid:21338178; @doi:10.1002/ptr.4714; @doi:10.1002/rcm.2795] in addition to its organoleptic properties, is a critically endangered species [@doi:10.3389/fphar.2015.00308].
Like other Gentianaceae, it is known to contain high amounts of xanthones and seco-iridoids [@doi:10/d7rkmh].
Among the known seco-iridoids of *S. chirayita* [@doi:10.1093/chromsci/bmac018], amarogentin is one of the most bitter compounds known to date, with a bitter value of 58,000,000 [@doi:10.1055/a-0654-1711].
Its content is highest in the roots [@doi:10.1016/j.phytochem.2015.05.007], root cultures methods [@doi:10.1055/s-2000-8579] are being developed to avoid its extinction [@doi:10.1007/978-981-16-3529-8_6].
For all these reasons, we decided to further study the enriched pre-fraction of the ethanolic extract of *S. chirayita* already analyzed in the Chapter @sec:cascade, to unravel its complex taste.
The presented workflow combines fractions enrichment, generic quantitative chemical evaluation through [NMR](#nmr), automated comprehensive compositional assessment through [HR](#hr)[MS/MS](#msms) methods and a novel combination of sensory evaluation methods.
Napping [@doi:10.3166/sda.23.679-688] was used in parallel to free descriptive profiles, and intensity of the obtained descriptors also assessed.
This untargeted methodology should facilitate the deconvolution of extracts with complex taste.
