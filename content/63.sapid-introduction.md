### Introduction {.page_break_before}

*Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H.Karst. is a bitter plant of important medical use in India [@pmid:22556747].
It grows between 1200 and 3200m in the Himalayan range [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0090637].
Since it is attributed an important quantity of medicinal virtues [@pmid:21338178; @doi:10.1002/ptr.4714; @doi:10.1002/rcm.2795] in addition to its organoleptic properties, is a critically endangered [@doi:10.3389/fphar.2015.00308].
As for all Gentianaceae, it is known to contain high amounts of xanthones and seco-iridoids [@doi:10/d7rkmh].
Among the known seco-iridoids of *S. chirayita* [@doi:10.1093/chromsci/bmac018], amarogentin is one of the most bitter compounds known to date, with a bitter value of 58,000,000 [@doi:10.1055/a-0654-1711].
Its content is maximal in the roots of the plant [@doi:10.1016/j.phytochem.2015.05.007], and therefore root cultures methods [@doi:10.1055/s-2000-8579] are being deveoped to avoid its extinction [@doi:10.1007/978-981-16-3529-8_6].
For all these reasons, we decided to further study the enriched pre-fraction of the ethanolic extract of *S. chirayita* already analyzed in Chapter @sec:cascade, to untangle its very complex taste.
