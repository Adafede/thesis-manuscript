### Introduction {.page_break_before}

*Swertia chirayita* (Roxb.) H.Karst. is a bitter plant of important medical use in India [@pmid:22556747].
It grows between 1200 and 3200m in the Himalayan range [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0090637].
As it is attributed a significant amount of medicinal properties [@pmid:21338178; @doi:10.1002/ptr.4714; @doi:10.1002/rcm.2795] in addition to its organoleptic properties, is a critically endangered species [@doi:10.3389/fphar.2015.00308].
Like other Gentianaceae, it is known to contain high amounts of xanthones and secoiridoids [@doi:10/d7rkmh].
Among the known secoiridoids of *S. chirayita* [@doi:10.1093/chromsci/bmac018], amarogentin is one of the most bitter compounds known to date, with a bitter value of 58,000,000 [@doi:10.1055/a-0654-1711].
Its content is highest in the roots [@doi:10.1016/j.phytochem.2015.05.007], root cultures methods [@doi:10.1055/s-2000-8579] are being developed to avoid its extinction [@doi:10.1007/978-981-16-3529-8_6].
For all these reasons, we decided to further study the enriched ethanolic extract of *S. chirayita* already analyzed in the Chapter @sec:cascade, to unravel its complex taste.
The presented workflow combines fractions enrichment, generic quantitative chemical evaluation through [NMR](#nmr), automated comprehensive compositional assessment through [HR](#hr)[MS/MS](#msms) methods and a novel combination of sensory evaluation methods.
For the organoleptic aspects, napping [@doi:10.3166/sda.23.679-688] was used in parallel to free descriptive profiles, and the intensity of the obtained descriptors was also assessed.
This untargeted methodology on both sensory and chemical sides should facilitate the deconvolution of extracts with a complex taste.
